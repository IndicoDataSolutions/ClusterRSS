Investors Service has confirmed the Aa3 issuer ratings of China National Offshore Oil Corporation CNOOC Group and its key subsidiary CNOOC Limited At the same time Moodys has also confirmed the Aa3 issuer rating of CNOOC Finance Corporation Ltd CNOOC Finance as well as the following guaranteed bond ratings 1 the Aa3 senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by CNOOC Finance 2003 Limited CNOOC Finance 2011 Limited CNOOC Finance 2012 Limited CNOOC Finance 2013 Limited CNOOC Nexen Finance 2014 ULC CNOOC Finance 2015 USA LLC and CNOOC Finance 2015 Australia Pty Ltd These issuances are guaranteed by CNOOC Limited 2 the Aa3 senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by CNOOC Curtis Funding No1 Pty Ltd and guaranteed by CNOOC Group 3 the Aa3 senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by Nexen Energy ULC as well as PAa3 senior unsecured shelf The ratings outlook is negative These rating actions conclude the review for downgrade announced by Moodys on 17 February 2016 RATINGS RATIONALE Moodys has lowered CNOOC Groups Baseline Credit Assessment BCA to baa1 from a3 as a result of a deterioration in CNOOCs financial profile due to t the weak oil price environment which we expect to continue However its final Aa3 issuer rating is unchanged as it continues to incorporate our assessment of the likelihood of a very high level of support from the Chinese government Aa3 negative if required under Moodys joint default analysis approach for government related issuers The assessment of a very high level of support reflects CNOOC Groups strategic importance to China given that it is one of the three major national oil companies in the country and that it dominates the offshore oil  gas operations CNOOC Group is 100 owned by the government of China and CNOOC Limited is 6444  owned by CNOOC Group The lower BCA of baa1 reflects Moodys expectation that CNOOC Groups credit metrics will continue to weaken Under Moodys price assumption of USD33barrel for Brent in 2016 and USD38barrel for 2017 CNOOC Groups retained cash flow RCFnet debt will likely be in the range of 25 to 30 in the next two years lower than Moodys estimates of 32 in 2015 These key credit metrics are more in line with its baa1 BCA relative to Moodysrated global peers We expect a similar weakening trend for its core subsidiary CNOOC Limited In our view the credit profiles of CNOOC Limited and CNOOC Group are closely linked as CNOOC Limited accounts for the majority of the parent groups revenue profits and assets CNOOC Groups baa1 BCA and CNOOC Limiteds standalone credit strength are supported by their 1 larger reserves and production scales when compared to most of their rated exploration and production EP peers 2 dominant positions in Chinas offshore oil  gas sector and 3 very strong internal liquidity sources and access to liquidity They are also most exposed to the low crude oil price among the rated Chinese national oil companies given their businesses focus more on upstream EP business Moodys believes that CNOOC Group and CNOOC Limited are likely to report negative free cash flow in 2016 but they will be able to use their cash on hand and liquid financial assets to prevent an material increase in their gross debt levels The negative outlook is in line with the negative outlook on Chinas Aa3 sovereign rating The ratings of CNOOC Group and CNOOC Limited are unlikely to be upgraded in the near term given the negative outlook A stable outlook could be considered if Chinas sovereign rating outlook returns to stable The ratings of CNOOC Limited and CNOOC Group could be downgraded if 1 Chinas sovereign rating is downgraded or 2 the companies embark on large debtfunded acquisitions or 3 crude oil prices drop further beyond Moodys expectations such that RCFnet debt falls below 2025 for both companies CNOOC Finances Aa3 issuer rating is closely linked with the rating of CNOOC Group as it is the sole entity managing CNOOC Groups treasury operations There is a commitment letter from CNOOC Group  as required under the regulations for Chinese corporates  that reinforces the importance of CNOOC Finance within CNOOC Group and the parents willingness to provide support to CNOOC Finance Furthermore CNOOC Finance does not have any external debt The principal methodology used in rating China National Offshore Oil Corporation was Global Integrated Oil  Gas Industry published in April 2014 Other methodologies used include the GovernmentRelated Issuers published in October 2014 The principal methodology used in rating CNOOC

Corporation -- Moody's confirms Aa3 ratings of CNOOC Group and CNOOC Ltd; \\u2026\", \"summary\": \"Rating Action Moodys confirms Aa3 ratings of CNOOC Group and CNOOC Ltd outlook negative Global Credit Research  30 Mar 2016 Hong Kong March 30 2016  Moodys Investors Service has confirmed the Aa3 issuer ratings of China National Offshore Oil Corporation CNOOC Group and its key subsidiary CNOOC Limited At the same time Moodys has also confirmed the Aa3 issuer rating of CNOOC Finance Corporation Ltd CNOOC Finance as well as the following guaranteed bond ratings 1 the Aa3 senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by CNOOC Finance 2003 Limited CNOOC Finance 2011 Limited CNOOC Finance 2012 Limited CNOOC Finance 2013 Limited CNOOC Nexen Finance 2014 ULC CNOOC Finance 2015 USA LLC and CNOOC Finance 2015 Australia Pty Ltd These issuances are guaranteed by CNOOC Limited 2 the Aa3 senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by CNOOC Curtis Funding No1 Pty Ltd and guaranteed by CNOOC Group 3 the Aa3 senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by Nexen Energy ULC as well as PAa3 senior unsecured shelf The ratings outlook is negative These rating actions conclude the review for downgrade announced by Moodys on 17 February 2016 RATINGS RATIONALE Moodys has lowered CNOOC Groups Baseline Credit Assessment BCA to baa1 from a3 as a result of a deterioration in CNOOCs financial profile due to t the weak oil price environment which we expect to continue However its final Aa3 issuer rating is unchanged as it continues to incorporate our assessment of the likelihood of a very high level of support from the Chinese government Aa3 negative if required under Moodys joint default analysis approach for government related issuers The assessment of a very high level of support reflects CNOOC Groups strategic importance to China given that it is one of the three major national oil companies in the country and that it dominates the offshore oil  gas operations CNOOC Group is 100 owned by the government of China and CNOOC Limited is 6444  owned by CNOOC Group The lower BCA of baa1 reflects Moodys expectation that CNOOC Groups credit metrics will continue to weaken Under Moodys price assumption of USD33barrel for Brent in 2016 and USD38barrel for 2017 CNOOC Groups retained cash flow RCFnet debt will likely be in the range of 25 to 30 in the next two years lower than Moodys estimates of 32 in 2015 These key credit metrics are more in line with its baa1 BCA relative to Moodysrated global peers We expect a similar weakening trend for its core subsidiary CNOOC Limited In our view the credit profiles of CNOOC Limited and CNOOC Group are closely linked as CNOOC Limited accounts for the majority of the parent groups revenue profits and assets CNOOC Groups baa1 BCA and CNOOC Limiteds standalone credit strength are supported by their 1 larger reserves and production scales when compared to most of their rated exploration and production EP peers 2 dominant positions in Chinas offshore oil  gas sector and 3 very strong internal liquidity sources and access to liquidity They are also most exposed to the low crude oil price among the rated Chinese national oil companies given their businesses focus more on upstream EP business Moodys believes that CNOOC Group and CNOOC Limited are likely to report negative free cash flow in 2016 but they will be able to use their cash on hand and liquid financial assets to prevent an material increase in their gross debt levels The negative outlook is in line with the negative outlook on Chinas Aa3 sovereign rating The ratings of CNOOC Group and CNOOC Limited are unlikely to be upgraded in the near term given the negative outlook A stable outlook could be considered if Chinas sovereign rating outlook returns to stable The ratings of CNOOC Limited and CNOOC Group could be downgraded if 1 Chinas sovereign rating is downgraded or 2 the companies embark on large debtfunded acquisitions or 3 crude oil prices drop further beyond Moodys expectations such that RCFnet debt falls below 2025 for both companies CNOOC Finances Aa3 issuer rating is closely linked with the rating of CNOOC Group as it is the sole entity managing CNOOC Groups treasury operations There is a commitment letter from CNOOC Group  as required under the regulations for Chinese corporates  that reinforces the importance of CNOOC Finance within CNOOC Group and the parents willingness to provide support to CNOOC Finance Furthermore CNOOC Finance does not have any external debt The principal methodology used in rating China National Offshore Oil Corporation was Global Integrated Oil  Gas Industry published in April 2014 Other methodologies used include the GovernmentRelated Issuers published in October 2014 The principal methodology used in rating CNOOC Limited was Global Independent Exploration and Production Industry published in December 2011 Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of

cumulative default rate for project finance bank loans is consistent with 10year cumulative default rates for corporate issuers of low investmentgrade credit quality says Andrew Davison a Moodys Senior Vice President and author of the report Ultimate recovery rates for project finance bank loans average 80 However in almost two thirds of cases the most likely ultimate recovery rate was 100

report via the link provided at the end of this press release Our latest study expands and updates the body of Moodys research which has informed market debate on the credit risk of project finance including the treatment of infrastructure project finance under Solvency II says Mr Davison The report shows that project finance is a robust class of specialised corporate lending even though project finance borrowers are highly leveraged thinly capitalised special purpose vehicles with limited financial flexibility The Study shows that marginal annual default rates improve significantly over time from financial close This seasoning characteristic differentiates the behaviour of project finance bank loans from corporate bank loans Marginal annual default rates a measure of the likelihood that a

Moodys Investors Service says in State Housing Finance Agencies  US Stronger Loan Performance and PentUp Demand Will Benefit HFAs in 2016 In addition increased home prices will help reduce losses on loans in bond programs leading to higher revenues which will help support asset levels of HFAs Moodys believes HFA financial health will continue even if an economic slowdown or a modest housing market decline occurs Home purchases through HFAs are also likely to increase from a rising number of millennials and other firsttime homebuyers taking advantage of HFA downpayment assistance programs in the current low unemployment and low interest rate environment that is making homeownership more affordable For HFAs that service loans the recent delinquency declines should translate into lower expenses and higher profitability as servicing and foreclosure costs fall David Teicher a Moodys Senior Vice President says Moodys says HFAs have also benefitted from the ongoing decline in seriously delinquent loans Data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show that the percentage of seriously delinquent Federal Housing Administration FHA insured fixedrate mortgage declined to 464 in the fourth quarter of 2015 the lowest level in a decade FHA loans share many of the same characteristics as HFA loans Origination of FHAinsured loans increased in 2015 in part due to the recent reduction in the cost of FHA insurance premiums This suggests HFA originations should similarly increase in 2016 since many HFA borrowers receive FHA insurance Teicher says State HFAs typically originate large percentages of FHAinsured single family mortgage loans and either hold them or sell them into the secondary market The report is available to Moodys subscribers at

Limited  Chesham Finance LLC  Series III Global Credit Research  14 Mar 2016 London 14 March 2016  Moodys Investors Service assigns a Prime1 sf rating to ECP assetbacked commercial paper issued by Chesham Finance Limited  Chesham Finance LLC Chesham under a new series Series III Chesham  Series III ECP Program Assigned P1 sf Chesham is an existing programme arranged by BSN Holdings Limited BSN and administered by QSR Management Limited QSR a wholly owned subsidiary of the The Bank of New York Mellon RATINGS RATIONALE On 7 April 2015 we assigned a Prime1 sf rating on the USCP issuance under Chesham  Series III Todays rating relates to the rating assignment on the ECP together with the USCP ABCP issuance under the same series Chesham  Series III ABCP is segregated from the existing ABCP of Chesham core ABCP and all other series of ABCP which may be issued from time to time The issuance proceeds of Chesham  Series III are used to acquire assets which are solely used as collateral for Chesham  Series III ABCP and to which no other securities issued by Chesham will have recourse Similarly Chesham  Series III noteholders will have no recourse to any of the assets which form collateral for other Chesham securities Segregation is by way of security limited recourse  nonpetition provisions separate custodial and bank accounts and operational procedures which apply to all classes of ABCP issued by Chesham Similar to Chesham core ABCP and the other series the Prime1 sf rating of Chesham  Series III is based on the credit and liquidity support provided by a repurchase agreements  securities lending agreements  deposits to be entered into with a single counterparty rated Prime1 initially and on the strict limits and robust procedures under which the programme will operate USE OF REPURCHASE DEPOSIT AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS TO ACHIEVE MATCH FUNDING  GENERALLY NO LIQUIDITY FACILITIES Collateral for Chesham  Series III is expected to be comprised of fixed or floating rate instruments including but not limited to commercial paper certificates of deposit time deposits bankers acceptances assetbacked securities freely transferable promissory notes government or corporate bonds debentures equities commodities loans repurchase agreements hedge agreements assetbacked commercial paper or any instrument of financial value In relation to Series III Chesham may in conjunction with the financing of each asset  enter into a repurchase agreement Repo or a securities lending agreements Loan under which the counterparty will be obliged to make a payment on or before the maturity date of the related ABCP or on demand in an amount at least equal to the face amount of maturing ABCP Chesham  Series III will not generally require any liquidity facilities due to the matched maturity profiles of its assets and liabilities Chesham  Series III will have only a single Prime1 rated counterparty in relation to its Repos Loans deposits and hedging and liquidity agreements The rating of Chesham  Series III is therefore directly linked to that of the counterparty to which it is exposed Unlike in relation to the Chesham core ABCP instead of being removed as a counterparty on downgrade the credit exposure will remain until maturity CHESHAM  SERIES III MAY ISSUE EXTENDIBLE CALLABLE OR PUTTABLE ABCP Chesham  Series III may be issued in the form of extendible ABCP which will only be done if the payments received from its Repos Loans deposits and  or hedging agreements will enable the ABCP to be repaid on its final maturity date This ability will be tested for each possible maturity of extendible ABCP up to its final maturity The Repos and Loans entered into may have put or call features embedded in them In order to manage the programmes liquidity the Issuer will attempt to issue ABCP with features that mirror those of the associated Repo or Loan Thus if the Issuer issues ABCP that can be put by the purchaser upon 7 days notice the Issuer will purchase an asset that may be put to the counterparty upon 7 or fewer days notice If the Issuer cannot issue ABCP with a call or put feature to match the opposing feature of a Repo or Loan the Issuer will enter into an appropriate hedge and or liquidity agreement to ensure repayment of ABCP DAILY NCO AND SENSITIVITY TESTS TO ENSURE ABCP CAN BE REPAID ON MATURITY QSR will test the Chesham  Series III portfolio daily and prior to each issuance of Series III ABCP or asset purchase to ensure that the ABCP will be able to be repaid on its maturity date ABCP cannot be issued unless Chesham in respect of Series III will remain in compliance with these respective tests Exceeding the permitted limits is an enforcement event in the respective series of ABCP An enforcement event in respect of Series III is not an enforcement event in respect of core ABCP or other series of ABCP issued by Chesham and vice versa The following tests will be run for the series  The net cumulative cash outflow NCO must not be greater than zero The NCO is computed as the worst case possible net outflow from the portfolio Every business day to the final maturity of the respective ABCP will be tested  Sensitivity to changes in interest rates and  Sensitivity to changes in currency exchange rates Moodys will monitor the results of these tests on a regular basis ORIGINATION AND ADMINISTRATION BSNs principal responsibilities as Investment Advisor are to originate and structure transactions identify securities to be financed and the associated Repo Loan or deposit to be entered into provide daytoday advice on request in relation to conduit administration of Chesham  Series III and arrange and structure any necessary hedging or liquidity agreements As is currently the case for the Chesham programme The Bank of New York Mellon will act as Security Trustee custodian and issuing and paying agent It will also provide cash administration and act as account bank QSR is the administrator of the Chesham programme and their role is extended to administration in respect of Chesham  Series III METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION The principal methodology used in this rating was Moodys Approach to Rating AssetBacked Commercial Paper published in July 2015 Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING The Prime1 sf rating of Chesham  Series III ABCP is correlated with the Prime1 rating of the related counterparty for the series in that a downgrade of this counterparty could result in a downgrade of the associated series of ABCP REGULATORY DISCLOSURES For further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections Methodology Assumptions and

Chesham Finance Limited / Chesham Finance \\u2026\", \"summary\": \"Rating Action Moodys Assigns Rating of Prime1 sf to ECP ABCP issued by Chesham Finance Limited  Chesham Finance LLC  Series III Global Credit Research  14 Mar 2016 London 14 March 2016  Moodys Investors Service assigns a Prime1 sf rating to ECP assetbacked commercial paper issued by Chesham Finance Limited  Chesham Finance LLC Chesham under a new series Series III Chesham  Series III ECP Program Assigned P1 sf Chesham is an existing programme arranged by BSN Holdings Limited BSN and administered by QSR Management Limited QSR a wholly owned subsidiary of the The Bank of New York Mellon RATINGS RATIONALE On 7 April 2015 we assigned a Prime1 sf rating on the USCP issuance under Chesham  Series III Todays rating relates to the rating assignment on the ECP together with the USCP ABCP issuance under the same series Chesham  Series III ABCP is segregated from the existing ABCP of Chesham core ABCP and all other series of ABCP which may be issued from time to time The issuance proceeds of Chesham  Series III are used to acquire assets which are solely used as collateral for Chesham  Series III ABCP and to which no other securities issued by Chesham will have recourse Similarly Chesham  Series III noteholders will have no recourse to any of the assets which form collateral for other Chesham securities Segregation is by way of security limited recourse  nonpetition provisions separate custodial and bank accounts and operational procedures which apply to all classes of ABCP issued by Chesham Similar to Chesham core ABCP and the other series the Prime1 sf rating of Chesham  Series III is based on the credit and liquidity support provided by a repurchase agreements  securities lending agreements  deposits to be entered into with a single counterparty rated Prime1 initially and on the strict limits and robust procedures under which the programme will operate USE OF REPURCHASE DEPOSIT AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS TO ACHIEVE MATCH FUNDING  GENERALLY NO LIQUIDITY FACILITIES Collateral for Chesham  Series III is expected to be comprised of fixed or floating rate instruments including but not limited to commercial paper certificates of deposit time deposits bankers acceptances assetbacked securities freely transferable promissory notes government or corporate bonds debentures equities commodities loans repurchase agreements hedge agreements assetbacked commercial paper or any instrument of financial value In relation to Series III Chesham may in conjunction with the financing of each asset  enter into a repurchase agreement Repo or a securities lending agreements Loan under which the counterparty will be obliged to make a payment on or before the maturity date of the related ABCP or on demand in an amount at least equal to the face amount of maturing ABCP Chesham  Series III will not generally require any liquidity facilities due to the matched maturity profiles of its assets and liabilities Chesham  Series III will have only a single Prime1 rated counterparty in relation to its Repos Loans deposits and hedging and liquidity agreements The rating of Chesham  Series III is therefore directly linked to that of the counterparty to which it is exposed Unlike in relation to the Chesham core ABCP instead of being removed as a counterparty on downgrade the credit exposure will remain until maturity CHESHAM  SERIES III MAY ISSUE EXTENDIBLE CALLABLE OR PUTTABLE ABCP Chesham  Series III may be issued in the form of extendible ABCP which will only be done if the payments received from its Repos Loans deposits and  or hedging agreements will enable the ABCP to be repaid on its final maturity date This ability will be tested for each possible maturity of extendible ABCP up to its final maturity The Repos and Loans entered into may have put or call features embedded in them In order to manage the programmes liquidity the Issuer will attempt to issue ABCP with features that mirror those of the associated Repo or Loan Thus if the Issuer issues ABCP that can be put by the purchaser upon 7 days notice the Issuer will purchase an asset that may be put to the counterparty upon 7 or fewer days notice If the Issuer cannot issue ABCP with a call or put feature to match the opposing feature of a Repo or Loan the Issuer will enter into an appropriate hedge and or liquidity agreement to ensure repayment of ABCP DAILY NCO AND SENSITIVITY TESTS TO ENSURE ABCP CAN BE REPAID ON MATURITY QSR will test the Chesham  Series III portfolio daily and prior to each issuance of Series III ABCP or asset purchase to ensure that the ABCP will be able to be repaid on its maturity date ABCP cannot be issued unless Chesham in respect of Series III will remain in compliance with these respective tests Exceeding the permitted limits is an enforcement event in the respective series of ABCP An enforcement event in respect of Series III is not an enforcement event in respect of core ABCP or other series of ABCP issued by Chesham and vice versa The following tests will be run for the series  The net cumulative cash outflow NCO must not be greater than zero The NCO is computed as the worst case possible net outflow from the portfolio Every business day to the final maturity of the respective ABCP will be tested  Sensitivity to changes in interest rates and  Sensitivity to changes in currency exchange rates Moodys will monitor the results of these tests on a regular basis ORIGINATION AND ADMINISTRATION BSNs principal responsibilities as Investment Advisor are to originate and structure transactions identify securities to be financed and the associated Repo Loan or deposit to be entered into provide daytoday advice on request in relation to conduit administration of Chesham  Series III and arrange and structure any necessary hedging or liquidity agreements As is currently the case for the Chesham programme The Bank of New York Mellon will act as Security Trustee custodian and issuing and paying agent It will also provide cash administration and act as account bank QSR is the administrator of the Chesham programme and their role is extended to administration in respect of Chesham  Series III METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION The principal methodology used in this rating was Moodys Approach to Rating AssetBacked Commercial Paper published in July 2015 Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING The Prime1 sf rating of Chesham  Series III ABCP is correlated with the Prime1 rating of the related counterparty for the series in that a downgrade of this counterparty could result in a downgrade of the associated series of ABCP REGULATORY DISCLOSURES For further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to

York March 29 2016  Moodys Investors Service has corrected the issuer information for ratings assigned to two secured term loans previously identified as having been issued by AWAS Aviation Capital Limited AWAS to reflect that the loans were in fact issued by AWAS subsidiaries with the guarantee of AWAS The Ba2 ratings assigned to the two loans issued by AWAS Finance Luxembourg SA in June 2010 and AWAS Finance Luxembourg 2012 SA in July 2012 are unchanged by this correction AWAS Ba3 corporate family rating and stable rating outlook are also unaffected RATINGS RATIONALE In May 2010 Moodys assigned a Ba2 rating to a proposed AWAS sixyear secured term loan When the transaction closed in June 2010 the loan was actually issued by AWAS Finance Luxembourg S rl AWAS LU now known as AWAS Finance Luxembourg SA with a full guarantee from AWAS Due to an oversight Moodys did not reflect the change in the identity of the issuer This has now been corrected by the withdrawal of the Ba2 rating on the secured term loan previously assigned to AWAS and the assignment of a Ba2 backed term loan rating to the secured term loan issued by AWAS LU In June 2012 Moodys assigned a prospective rating of PBa2 to a proposed AWAS sixyear secured term loan When the transaction closed the loan was actually issued by AWAS Finance Luxembourg 2012 SA AWAS LU 2012 with a full guarantee from AWAS Moodys assigned a definitive Ba2 rating to the secured term loan in August 2012 Due to an oversight Moodys did not reflect the change in issuer This has now been corrected by the withdrawal of the Ba2 secured term loan rating previously assigned to AWAS and the assignment of a Ba2 backed term loan rating to the secured term loan issued by AWAS LU 2012 These corrections do not affect the Ba2 ratings assigned to the two term loans The ratings of both loans reflect their seniority in the respective borrowers capital structure the strength of the loans collateral pledge and loan covenants and the credit profile of AWAS as guarantor The ratings are one notch higher than AWAS Ba3 corporate family rating to reflect that the loans terms provide meaningfully lower risk of loss to secured creditors based on the pledge of ownership interests of aircraft owning subsidiaries as well as security assignments of associated aircraft leases and loantovalue covenants that are tested semiannually based on three independent aircraft appraisals The guarantees provided by AWAS meet Moodys standard for full credit substitution AWAS Ba3 corporate family rating is based on its strong operating cash flow solid competitive positioning as a midtier commercial aircraft leasing company and acceptable balance among its portfolio risk exposures geographic aircraft type and model and customer Credit constraints include the companys high reliance on secured funding that limits its operational and financial flexibility Moodys expectation that the companys leverage will increase moderately over the intermediate term and uncertainty regarding the companys ultimate ownership The stable outlook reflects Moodys expectation that AWAS will continue to achieve solid profitability but that leverage will moderately increase as a result of distributions to the companys owners AWAS corporate family rating could be upgraded if the company continues recent strength in operating results leverage DTNW declines to 25x or lower it maintains balanced fleet composition and risk characteristics and effectively manages liquidity considering its financing requirements and growth objectives Further funding diversification that materially reduces the reliance on secured debt would strengthen AWAS prospects for a rating upgrade AWAS corporate family rating could be downgraded if profitability materially declines leverage DTNW increases to more than 35x given current fleet risk characteristics or if liquidity weakens AWAS Aviation Capital Limited headquartered in Dublin Ireland is a commercial aircraft leasing company The principal methodology used in this rating was Finance Companies published in October 2015 Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this

RATINGS RATIONALE Todays rating actions follow Moodys rating action on the collateral assets on March 11 2016 The ratings on the collateral assets have been downgraded to A3 from A1 The ratings of the transactions mainly reflect the credit quality of the collateral asset the credit quality of the swap counterparty and the strength of the transaction structure If the rating on the collateral assets and swap counterparties change the ratings on the loans may also change The principal methodology used in these ratings was Moodys Approach to Rating Repackaged Securities Japanese published in June 2015 Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade or upgrade are a deterioration or improvement in the credit quality of the collateral asset and the swap counterparty Loss and Cash Flow Analysis Our quantitative analysis focuses on the risks relating to the credit quality of the assets backing the repack and of the counterparties We generally determine the expected loss posed to securities holders by adding together the severities for loss scenarios arising from either collateral asset default and if applicable swap counterparty risk each weighted according to its respective probability We then translate the expected loss to a rating using our idealized loss rates REGULATORY DISCLOSURES For further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections Methodology Assumptions and

Reverse Dual Currency Loan  JPY 2952114750 Series 20063 Reverse Dual Currency Loan Downgraded to Baa1 sf previously on January 26 2016 A2 sf Placed Under Review for Downgrade RATINGS RATIONALE Todays rating actions follow Moodys rating action on the collateral assets on March 11 2016 The ratings on the collateral assets have been downgraded to A3 from A1 The ratings of the transactions mainly reflect the credit quality of the collateral asset the credit quality of the swap counterparty and the strength of the transaction structure If the rating on the collateral assets and swap counterparties change the ratings on the loans may also change The principal methodology used in these ratings was Moodys Approach to Rating Repackaged Securities Japanese published in June 2015 Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade or upgrade are a deterioration or improvement in the credit quality of the collateral asset and the swap counterparty Loss and Cash Flow Analysis Our quantitative analysis focuses on the risks relating to the credit quality of the assets backing the repack and of the counterparties We generally determine the expected loss posed to securities holders by adding together the severities for loss scenarios arising from either collateral asset default and if applicable swap counterparty risk each weighted according to its respective probability We then translate the expected loss to a rating using our idealized loss rates REGULATORY DISCLOSURES For further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections Methodology Assumptions and

set sail and the speed of a car traveling from Poughkeepsie to Buffalo in five hours but too many have no idea how much their savings account can earn With financial literacy stuck at dismal rates the call for better financial education in public schools is amplifying But while the intentions behind this push are laudable questions linger about how financial subjects should be taught  and whether theyre even teachable for school children The financial education movement has been gaining momentum for more than a decade The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau added its considerable weight in 2013 with a set of recommendations for teaching financial topics to all grade levels We are deeply committed to a vision of an America where everyone is financially educated said CFPB Director Richard Cordray in the white paper outlining the bureaus recommendations We should start where all good education starts  with our children Among his organizations recommendations Teach personal finance at every grade level include the material on standardized tests and require students to take a standalone personal finance class before graduation The UK and Australia are already mandating such actions See Lessons from overseas on financial education The bureaus advice echoes that of the Presidents Council on Financial Capability which recommended in January 2013 that states incorporate personal finance into the Common Core Standards for English and math The Common Core is a set of benchmarks adopted by 45 states spelling out what K12 students should know at the end of each grade Numbers tell the storySurvey after survey show Americans dont understand basic financial concepts In the 2012 Financial Capability Study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for example less than half of respondents scored a passing grade on five simple questions about financial fundamentals Only 39 percent answered three or more questions correctly down from 42 percent in 2009 High school students fare even worse Nearly threequarters failed the quiz in the 2008 survey by the Jumptart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy with fewer than 5 percent earning the equivalent of a C or better New payment products such as prepaid debit cards gift cards and mobile payments make the financial landscape even more complex for todays teens How costly is ignorance Look no further than the recent financial crisis says the CFPB It was brought on partly by Americans ensnared in debt and credit products they couldnt afford The bureau says education is the best hope for preventing a recurrence Young people today and future generations should not have to repeat the financial mistakes made by earlier generations wrote Cordray in the CFPB white paper State records are spottyThe feds are pushing financial literacy because states which control education policy are inconsistent in their approaches Fortysix now include personal finance in their educational standards compared to only 21 in the 1990s But only 17 states require high school students to take a personal finance class and five require testing on economic topics When the law does not require implementation of specific education standards they become voluntary and less effective tending to take a back seat to the required education standards says the CFPBs white paper Just ask Stuart Greenfeld adjunct economics professor at Austin Community College Until the 201314 school year Texas high schools were not required to offer personal finance courses When Greenfeld surveyed his classes at the beginning of the 2013 school year only eight of his 84 students had taken a high school personal finance course But 47 had credit cards  including 10 high school students in an early college start program Less than a quarter of his students knew the difference between simple and compound interest I was sort of shocked at the lack of knowledge they had he says Julia Angelem remembers all too well the limitations of the personal finance lessons she received in a lifestyle class at her Seattle high school in the late 1980s It was taught by a coach she laughs Thats how much they cared about it Although she learned basics like how to write a check she says the lessons never covered reallife budgeting challenges A few years later she left college with thousands of dollars in credit card debt Her mother finally sat her down and talked to her about money  a discussion Angelem wishes theyd had a decade earlier With Moms help she learned how to manage on her modest starting salary and eventually she dug her way out of debt Now a mother herself she is teaching her own children about money and credit so they wont make the same mistakes she did She thinks schools have a role to play too If were going to have lifestyle classes where the kids carry around a baby for a week it should be much more realistic she says It should look at why debt is bad If we could slice out 10 percent of the curriculum for something kids will really use in the future I would support that But does it workTrouble is theres not much evidence that formal education in financial concepts works for children as young as five  or even for teens The 2008 Jumptart survey famously showed that students who took a personal finance class in high school scored no differently than those who didnt Critics note research flaws in the study but the results turned the surveys author economist Lewis Mandell from a financial education proponent into its loudest skeptic Mandell now argues its better to wait to teach financial information until just before its needed Your motivation to learn about say mortgages is highest when youre buying a house Teaching material preneed is a waste because students forget it says Mandell If you measure the amount theyve learned by their scores on the final and contrast it with what they knew going into it they will show incredible learning he admits But if you ask them a year later theyll have no recollection of it because theres no real reason why the material should be sticky Harvard professor Brigitte Madrian codirector of the household finance working group for the National Bureau of Economic Research agrees Theres only so much we could expect of any initiative to increase financial literacy in the public schools just because a lot of what youd like people to know how to do youre going to have a hard time teaching successfully because the decisions arent relevant she says Mandell goes even further arguing that preneed financial education is not just ineffective its unethical The few kids who do well in it are those who excel in most other subjects too he says and they tend to come from wealthier bettereducated families To waste very scarce educational resources on something that we know is just going to be of interest and advantage to those who are already holding all the marbles just strikes me as very pathetic and very very unfair Mandell says Whats more the focus on education neglects the fact that some economic hardships are beyond the control of individuals say Mandell and other critics Their alternative make financial systems simpler For example studies show that when the default 401k option for employees is automatic enrollment participation rates increase Chile is considering applying this principle to its student loan program by limiting loan amounts based on extensive research into what students can expect to earn in their chosen fields Better than ignoranceProponents of financial education in public schools counter that policy changes wont suffice  and education is less expensive than the alternative People make too many financial decisions for a few policy changes or changes in the choice architecture to be enough says Annamaria Lusardi distinguished professor at The George Washington University School of Business and founder of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center Its going to be much cheaper to equip people with the tools they need to make decisions than to rescue them later on when theyve gotten into trouble Education advocates also complain that the bar is higher for financial education than other subjects Just because you dont remember logarithms doesnt mean that math failed says Jeanne Hogarth vice president of policy at the Center for Financial Services Innovation and a former economist with the Federal Reserve We need to cut financial education a bit of slack While no solid studies show that K12 financial education leads to better decisionmaking later in life some experts find hope in research by Bill Skimmyhorn an assistant economics professor at West Point Skimmyhorn looked at the effects of the Armys Personal Financial Management Course PFMC an eighthour mandatory class rolled out in 2007 and 2008 for all new activeduty enlisted soldiers The largest study of its kind it examined the behaviors of soldiers who took the class over a twoyear period The most significant finding was that the course had a very powerful effect on retirement savings and some moderate but important effects on savings and credit behaviors says Skimmyhorn Soldiers who took the PFMC were twice as likely to participate in the militarys retirement plan and saved twice as much as those who did not take the course At the same time the credit balances of PFMC graduates were 10 percent to 12 percent lower than those of soldiers who did not take the course So it appears the graduates were saving more and spending less Which teaching methods are bestEven if those results translate for public school children experts disagree on the best methods of instruction Skimmyhorn notes that personal finance is different from math or reading because the student has to not only absorb the lessons but be disciplined enough to apply them He thinks the implication of his research for public schools may be that the curriculum needs to be very relevant to student needs  the sort of justintime approach Mandell recommends Teaching juniors and seniors in high school how to do a net present value analysis will prove very difficult and probably wont affect their behavior he advises Instead you might provide them with some rules of thumb some advice for their situation or direct them to other available resources Others say that while justintime learning is important you cant wait until the last minute to get basics such as the difference between a need and a want See What to teach They maintain that schools should teach principles  early and often  because kids form impressions about money early and cumulative learning drives increasingly responsible financial behavior as they grow up I think people mistake the teaching of financial literacy with a particular event when its really about teaching habits of thought says Nan Morrison president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education Opening a bank account is a onetime event Were trying to teach kids skills and tools they can apply to any decision they may face going forward Schools can do that without breaking the bank by incorporating financial lessons into other subjects says the CFPB Thats what Colorado schools are doing In fall 2013 the state integrated personal finance into its math and social studies standards which schools are required to teach Melissa Colsman executive director of the teaching and learning unit at the Colorado Department of Education says the move fills an important gap Before the standards were implemented most schools did not take a comprehensive approach to teaching students how to make good financial decisions she says As for lesson style the CFPB and most educators say that handson experiential learning is the way to get through to kids Holly Winter is among them She devised a system for her junior high math and literacy students at Denvers Morgridge Academy where they each owe 1200 a week in play money to rent their desks They earn the funds by coming to class on time and doing their homework and extra credit assignments If they do everything theyre supposed to they end up with a little extra to save toward rewards such as a nohomework pass Mostly though Winter tries not to give prizes I want them to know that it feels really good to be in the black and it feels bad to be in the red says Winter who once struggled with credit card debt And they do They hate going into the red According to Mandell though play money isnt enough The real learning doesnt begin until youre teaching with genuine cash Everyone has to have some skin in the game he says The one type of public school program he supports involves setting up savings accounts for students San Franciscos Kindergarten to College K2C program is a great example Since 2012 San Francisco has put 50 for each kindergartener into a college savings account that parents and others can contribute to The schools are also integrating financial subjects into the childrens math curriculum using the accounts as a teaching tool Educators are watching closely to see what effect the program has on future behaviors In fact experts are all eager for better research on the efficacy of school financial literacy programs Even Harvards Madrian a skeptic admits that if she had a niece or nephew who didnt have the benefit of her economic instruction she would want them to be able to take a class in school But she would want the curriculum to be rolled out on a small scale and tested over time That would then inform how you would want to change things going forward she says Were not going to have any data until we go out and do something In the meantime I have to believe education works says Hogarth See related Financial literacy online resources for parents children

looks there arent many jobs where you can work nine months a year do something you enjoy get holidays Christmas and spring break off and earn a sixfigure salary at the same time To many it sounds like paradise but like our friends the economists say there is no free lunch You may enjoy finance and investing as a student but it is a long way from the students desk to the professors Teaching classes is only one part of a college professors ongoing responsibilities Depending on the school where they work professors will also have committee meetings and research requirements The old adage applies to business school professors as much as it does for anyone else in academics its publish or perish Depending on the type of school where they work professors could be asked to publish as many as two to three academic articles per year Why Do Business School Professors Have Such High SalariesNot to slight English or history professors but there arent many private sector jobs available for them and there certainly arent as many students lining up at every major college across the United States to get a masters degree in history as there are for the Master of Business Administration MBA degree These two types of demand apply to finance professors and other disciplines like accounting What About the Supply of ProfessorsWhile business school professors are in high demand there is not a lot of supply By some estimates there are only 350 new grads each year and almost 500 new job openings remember Wall Street wants some of these people as well Many PhD programs in finance arent very big and are also not found at many schools There are very few smaller public universities nearly no liberal arts schools and only a select number of the larger schools that even have finance PhD programs Many states have only one or two programs In the existing programs only a handful of students  often only five to 10  are admitted every year Another issue regarding the supply of business professors is that many college professors in the US are baby boomers who earned their PhDs in the 1960s and 1970s and will be retiring within the next 10 years For those entering the field this may mean big opportunities down the line What Does This Career Actually EntailDepending on the school where they teach professors usually have a fairly flexible weekly schedule The type of workload and research expectations should be an important factor when considering where to work Here are a few points to consider A typical teaching load is two to four classes per semester these classes could involve instructing both undergrad and master level students If the school has a PhD program the professor will likely be teaching these classes andor advising these students Professors conduct their own research often with graduate students assisting for submission to academic publications and possibly to industry sources The more prestigious the university the more research tends to be emphasized over teaching Even though most students never see this side of their professors work professors also serve on faculty committees and advise students For PhD students the professor might serve on dissertation committees working on research with the students and helping to provide guidance in other ways Many smaller state and local schools are teaching oriented while more prestigious schools will expect a lot more in the way of research output At toprated schools teacher of the year awards dont carry nearly as much weight as publications in the top journals Parents of collegebound students should note this as well when considering where to send junior next fall Sounds Good so Where Do I Sign UpWell now that you know all about how to become a finance professor theres just one small problem in order to teach you need a PhD Sure you can teach as an adjunct instructor for the thrill of teaching and a little extra money but without a PhD you cant get tenure or a good salary 80000 120000 per year for a ninemonth contract The traditional strategy is to go to the best school you can get into and go out of state from where you want to end up The outofstate strategy is helpful due to factors of supply and demand If one is in Iowa for example then there are many more University of Iowa PhDs looking for jobs than University of Michigan grads In academics intellectual diversity is big but so is prestige If you want to work at an Ivy League school and get paid more than 200000 per year youll a PhD from an equivalent school The general rule in academics is that you can always go down a notch for work and usually sideways but almost never upwards  unless you win the Nobel Prize or another prestigious award The problem is that everyone in the field knows this and the spots for these usually small programs are extremely tough to get  often much more selective than for top MBA or undergrad spots Whats Involved in Getting a PhD in BusinessDepending on ones other graduate education expect to complete four to five years of school before getting the opportunity to teach those eager young minds During this schooling youll take advanced math courses such as linearmatrix algebra and finite math as well as a number of statisticstype courses such as econometrics regression multivariate and timeseries analysis This is required in order to do the statistical research for your dissertation and other independent research after graduation This emphasis on math and statistics may be the single biggest hindrance for most considering this field The Bottom LineIf you want to go to a school that is in the mid to upper tier then your PhD work will have more in common with a math major than a money manager unless you work at a quantitative hedge fund If teaching is your passion and perhaps you dont really want to do research with your time then plan on a teachingoriented school One handy rule is that if a university has a PhD program in one or more

The US is not alone in its attempts to address financial literacy in public schools An international push is on to teach kids the money skills they need to navigate todays increasingly challenging financial landscape Financial instruments are much more complex than they were a generation ago when credit card usage was limited and debt was confined to a mortgage and maybe a car loan The options have multiplied all over the world Thats why this is a global movement says Annamaria Lusardi distinguished professor at The George Washington University School of Business and founder of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center Its not just the US though the US has a more complex economy and has bigger problems than other countries in my view International comparisons are trickyWhen it comes to the financial knowhow of young people comparing different countries is difficult The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for the first time included financial literacy questions on its 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment PISA an exam given every three years to 15yearolds around the world To see how well you fare on some of the OECDs sample questions take our interactive quiz Those results wont be released until later in 2014 But PISA math results released in December ranked the US at No 36  below average for the 65 countries involved Since numeracy is tied to financial literacy its not a stretch to predict that American students will come out somewhere around the middle of the financial literacy results A 2012 World Bank report Financial Literacy around the World provides a glimpse of how adults in different countries compare It looked at how they answered three questions that cover basic understanding of compound interest inflation and risk diversification The US ranks near the bottom of seven highincome countries on the interest and inflation questions and toward the middle on the risk problem The surveys were given in different years and some countries used variations on the questions so comparisons are only approximate Lessons from abroadAs the US tries to tackle financial education it is keeping a close eye on what other countries are doing Teachers in England are required to incorporate personal finance topics into math classes in 2014 bringing that country up to the standards of Northern Ireland Scotland and Wales where schools are already required to teach personal finance Australia is also rolling out a national financial literacy curriculum in its public schools Those kinds of national mandates are not possible in the US with its decentralized education system Australia and the UK have very top down systems where the government says You will put this in your curriculum says Jeanne Hogarth vice president of policy at the Center for Financial Services Innovation and a frequent financial literacy speaker In the US we have a very grass roots approach when it comes to education Local school boards decide everything The US might draw lessons from New Zealand whose education system is also decentralized New Zealanders scored higher than the residents of 14 other countries not including the US when measured on eight core financial knowledge concepts by the OECD International experts routinely praise the small country for its initiatives  it was the first to create an independent website dedicated to educational resources for consumers wwwsortedorgnz In the past few years the government has been putting strong emphasis on increased financial capability as one of the key elements in improving the economic health of individuals in the nation says Pushpa Wood director of the Financial Education and Research Centre at Massey University Wood points out that other factors probably contribute to New Zealands high scores a small population about 44 million that is relatively easy to reach with educational messages and a high proportion of banked consumers who are engaged with financial products Still figuring it outWood says there is still much room for improvement Much like the US New Zealand is still feeling its way to a more financially literate public According to Wood financial literacy is included by implication in the countrys core education objectives which stipulate that a student should be able to contribute economically to the nation by the time they leave school But New Zealand cannot mandate financial literacy classes in public schools for reasons similar to those of the US Individual schools decide whether to teach personal finance topics Were now adopting a beachhead strategy says Malcolm Menzies group manager of research and corporate services at New Zealands Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income Weve seen success in schools that have passionate champions for financial literacy and were working with them to engage with other schools The government is also trying to address another pain point teacher confidence New Zealand is piloting programs to train teachers not only in the financial knowledge they need to pass on but also in effective methods for teaching it The holy grail is to have teachers be confident enough that if a financial question comes up in another class such as social studies they can address it says Menzies He would like to see the pilot program expanded pointing to Australia which is pouring millions of dollars into training thousands of teachers If we could put 10000 teachers through then wed be getting somewhere he says See related Infographic Brazil top nation for financial literacy

student loan borrowers to manage their loans borrowers are still struggling In fact between October 1 and December 31 2015 private debt collection companies hired by the Department of Education garnished more than 176 million in wages from defaulted student loan borrowers in order to pay back their debts according to data released last week Though the government provides a variety of options to help student loan borrowers manage their payments it also has extraordinary powers  including wage garnishment  to collect on the debt if a borrower defaults Theres not much historical data on how much student loan debt collectors have secured through wage garnishment so its hard to say whether there are fewer borrowers being subjected to wage garnishment than in previous years The government did release similar data last year which showed that the companies collected 170 million over the three months leading up to October of 2015 To be sure these companies do collect more by other means  more than three quarters of the money the companies recovered for the Department came through rehabilitations a process that allows defaulted borrowers to become current on their student loans after a series of on time payments Still the sheer size of the pot taken from borrowers wages is horrifying said Chris Hicks an independent researcher who focuses on student debt These are people who cant afford to pay their student loans and theyve garnished 176 million in three months from them said Hicks who also works as a consultant for progressive organizations You have to wonder what conditions people are living in when theyre seeing that much of their wages garnished Whats more the share of total borrowers who should be making payments on their loans but are defaulting instead hit its highest level in three years last quarter according to an analysis of the data released last week by Jason Delisle the director of the Federal Education Budget Project at New America a Washingtonbased think tank Both the high levels of wage garnishment and default suggest that despite efforts from the Obama administration to make student loans more manageable for borrowers a decent number are still struggling Jason Delisle The share of borrowers with loans due but are actually defaulting hit its highest level in three years last quarter Delisle notes More than 336000 borrowers entered default last quarter alone and more than 1 million borrowers entered default last year according to the Departments data This is the first time the Department has released this metric so its hard to say if it represents an improvement from previous years Hicks said hes particularly concerned that it appears that tens of thousands of borrowers are entering default for the second time each quarter the Department measured Borrowers who default more than once on their federal student loans have limited options to become current on their payments and get their financial lives back on track All of these defaults keep happening even as the Obama administration has made it easier for borrowers to make payments on their student loans tied to their income a step which should theoretically prevent borrowers from defaulting In its data release The Department also noted that as of December 2015 nearly 46 million borrowers with direct loans were taking advantage of these programs a 48 increase from a year earlier This growth in uptake of these programs is partially responsible for the decline in the share of borrowers delinquent for 31 days or more from a year earlier Despite the uptick in use in incomedriven payment programs Hicks said the high levels of default suggest that servicers the private companies that manage the repayment process arent doing enough to make borrowers aware of their options He also noted that many borrowers having their wages garnished likely qualify for very low monthly payments on incomedriven plans and they may have defaulted and subsequently faced wage garnishment because theyre not aware of their other options Its obviously too complex for people to figure out and the servicers arent doing a good job of helping people navigate it he said To make things easier the government launched a new repayment program at the end of last year that allows any student loan borrower to cap monthly payments at 10 of her income In addition the Department the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Treasury Department signed a joint statement of principles on student loan servicing to better hold companies accountable for helping borrowers But from Delisiles perspective borrowers access to plans that help them manage their loan payments isnt the issue The increase in defaults combined with the jump in borrowers enrolled in incomedriven programs indicates to him that offering a wide swath of incomedriven plans may not be the best way to help the borrowers who are truly struggling said Delisle He said he doesnt see a quick fix to this problem but he feels policy makers should be considering bold ideas to address high levels of default that could include things like payroll withholding The policy makers and what they want to do on student

set sail and the speed of a car traveling from Poughkeepsie to Buffalo in five hours but too many have no idea how much their savings account can earn With financial literacy stuck at dismal rates the call for better financial education in public schools is amplifying But while the intentions behind this push are laudable questions linger about how financial subjects should be taught  and whether theyre even teachable for school children The financial education movement has been gaining momentum for more than a decade The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau added its considerable weight in 2013 with a set of recommendations for teaching financial topics to all grade levels We are deeply committed to a vision of an America where everyone is financially educated said CFPB Director Richard Cordray in the white paper outlining the bureaus recommendations We should start where all good education starts  with our children Among his organizations recommendations Teach personal finance at every grade level include the material on standardized tests and require students to take a standalone personal finance class before graduation The UK and Australia are already mandating such actions See Lessons from overseas on financial education The bureaus advice echoes that of the Presidents Council on Financial Capability which recommended in January 2013 that states incorporate personal finance into the Common Core Standards for English and math The Common Core is a set of benchmarks adopted by 45 states spelling out what K12 students should know at the end of each grade Numbers tell the storySurvey after survey show Americans dont understand basic financial concepts In the 2012 Financial Capability Study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for example less than half of respondents scored a passing grade on five simple questions about financial fundamentals Only 39 percent answered three or more questions correctly down from 42 percent in 2009 High school students fare even worse Nearly threequarters failed the quiz in the 2008 survey by the Jumptart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy with fewer than 5 percent earning the equivalent of a C or better New payment products such as prepaid debit cards gift cards and mobile payments make the financial landscape even more complex for todays teens How costly is ignorance Look no further than the recent financial crisis says the CFPB It was brought on partly by Americans ensnared in debt and credit products they couldnt afford The bureau says education is the best hope for preventing a recurrence Young people today and future generations should not have to repeat the financial mistakes made by earlier generations wrote Cordray in the CFPB white paper State records are spottyThe feds are pushing financial literacy because states which control education policy are inconsistent in their approaches Fortysix now include personal finance in their educational standards compared to only 21 in the 1990s But only 17 states require high school students to take a personal finance class and five require testing on economic topics When the law does not require implementation of specific education standards they become voluntary and less effective tending to take a back seat to the required education standards says the CFPBs white paper Just ask Stuart Greenfeld adjunct economics professor at Austin Community College Until the 201314 school year Texas high schools were not required to offer personal finance courses When Greenfeld surveyed his classes at the beginning of the 2013 school year only eight of his 84 students had taken a high school personal finance course But 47 had credit cards  including 10 high school students in an early college start program Less than a quarter of his students knew the difference between simple and compound interest I was sort of shocked at the lack of knowledge they had he says Julia Angelem remembers all too well the limitations of the personal finance lessons she received in a lifestyle class at her Seattle high school in the late 1980s It was taught by a coach she laughs Thats how much they cared about it Although she learned basics like how to write a check she says the lessons never covered reallife budgeting challenges A few years later she left college with thousands of dollars in credit card debt Her mother finally sat her down and talked to her about money  a discussion Angelem wishes theyd had a decade earlier With Moms help she learned how to manage on her modest starting salary and eventually she dug her way out of debt Now a mother herself she is teaching her own children about money and credit so they wont make the same mistakes she did She thinks schools have a role to play too If were going to have lifestyle classes where the kids carry around a baby for a week it should be much more realistic she says It should look at why debt is bad If we could slice out 10 percent of the curriculum for something kids will really use in the future I would support that But does it workTrouble is theres not much evidence that formal education in financial concepts works for children as young as five  or even for teens The 2008 Jumptart survey famously showed that students who took a personal finance class in high school scored no differently than those who didnt Critics note research flaws in the study but the results turned the surveys author economist Lewis Mandell from a financial education proponent into its loudest skeptic Mandell now argues its better to wait to teach financial information until just before its needed Your motivation to learn about say mortgages is highest when youre buying a house Teaching material preneed is a waste because students forget it says Mandell If you measure the amount theyve learned by their scores on the final and contrast it with what they knew going into it they will show incredible learning he admits But if you ask them a year later theyll have no recollection of it because theres no real reason why the material should be sticky Harvard professor Brigitte Madrian codirector of the household finance working group for the National Bureau of Economic Research agrees Theres only so much we could expect of any initiative to increase financial literacy in the public schools just because a lot of what youd like people to know how to do youre going to have a hard time teaching successfully because the decisions arent relevant she says Mandell goes even further arguing that preneed financial education is not just ineffective its unethical The few kids who do well in it are those who excel in most other subjects too he says and they tend to come from wealthier bettereducated families To waste very scarce educational resources on something that we know is just going to be of interest and advantage to those who are already holding all the marbles just strikes me as very pathetic and very very unfair Mandell says Whats more the focus on education neglects the fact that some economic hardships are beyond the control of individuals say Mandell and other critics Their alternative make financial systems simpler For example studies show that when the default 401k option for employees is automatic enrollment participation rates increase Chile is considering applying this principle to its student loan program by limiting loan amounts based on extensive research into what students can expect to earn in their chosen fields Better than ignoranceProponents of financial education in public schools counter that policy changes wont suffice  and education is less expensive than the alternative People make too many financial decisions for a few policy changes or changes in the choice architecture to be enough says Annamaria Lusardi distinguished professor at The George Washington University School of Business and founder of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center Its going to be much cheaper to equip people with the tools they need to make decisions than to rescue them later on when theyve gotten into trouble Education advocates also complain that the bar is higher for financial education than other subjects Just because you dont remember logarithms doesnt mean that math failed says Jeanne Hogarth vice president of policy at the Center for Financial Services Innovation and a former economist with the Federal Reserve We need to cut financial education a bit of slack While no solid studies show that K12 financial education leads to better decisionmaking later in life some experts find hope in research by Bill Skimmyhorn an assistant economics professor at West Point Skimmyhorn looked at the effects of the Armys Personal Financial Management Course PFMC an eighthour mandatory class rolled out in 2007 and 2008 for all new activeduty enlisted soldiers The largest study of its kind it examined the behaviors of soldiers who took the class over a twoyear period The most significant finding was that the course had a very powerful effect on retirement savings and some moderate but important effects on savings and credit behaviors says Skimmyhorn Soldiers who took the PFMC were twice as likely to participate in the militarys retirement plan and saved twice as much as those who did not take the course At the same time the credit balances of PFMC graduates were 10 percent to 12 percent lower than those of soldiers who did not take the course So it appears the graduates were saving more and spending less Which teaching methods are bestEven if those results translate for public school children experts disagree on the best methods of instruction Skimmyhorn notes that personal finance is different from math or reading because the student has to not only absorb the lessons but be disciplined enough to apply them He thinks the implication of his research for public schools may be that the curriculum needs to be very relevant to student needs  the sort of justintime approach Mandell recommends Teaching juniors and seniors in high school how to do a net present value analysis will prove very difficult and probably wont affect their behavior he advises Instead you might provide them with some rules of thumb some advice for their situation or direct them to other available resources Others say that while justintime learning is important you cant wait until the last minute to get basics such as the difference between a need and a want See What to teach They maintain that schools should teach principles  early and often  because kids form impressions about money early and cumulative learning drives increasingly responsible financial behavior as they grow up I think people mistake the teaching of financial literacy with a particular event when its really about teaching habits of thought says Nan Morrison president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education Opening a bank account is a onetime event Were trying to teach kids skills and tools they can apply to any decision they may face going forward Schools can do that without breaking the bank by incorporating financial lessons into other subjects says the CFPB Thats what Colorado schools are doing In fall 2013 the state integrated personal finance into its math and social studies standards which schools are required to teach Melissa Colsman executive director of the teaching and learning unit at the Colorado Department of Education says the move fills an important gap Before the standards were implemented most schools did not take a comprehensive approach to teaching students how to make good financial decisions she says As for lesson style the CFPB and most educators say that handson experiential learning is the way to get through to kids Holly Winter is among them She devised a system for her junior high math and literacy students at Denvers Morgridge Academy where they each owe 1200 a week in play money to rent their desks They earn the funds by coming to class on time and doing their homework and extra credit assignments If they do everything theyre supposed to they end up with a little extra to save toward rewards such as a nohomework pass Mostly though Winter tries not to give prizes I want them to know that it feels really good to be in the black and it feels bad to be in the red says Winter who once struggled with credit card debt And they do They hate going into the red According to Mandell though play money isnt enough The real learning doesnt begin until youre teaching with genuine cash Everyone has to have some skin in the game he says The one type of public school program he supports involves setting up savings accounts for students San Franciscos Kindergarten to College K2C program is a great example Since 2012 San Francisco has put 50 for each kindergartener into a college savings account that parents and others can contribute to The schools are also integrating financial subjects into the childrens math curriculum using the accounts as a teaching tool Educators are watching closely to see what effect the program has on future behaviors In fact experts are all eager for better research on the efficacy of school financial literacy programs Even Harvards Madrian a skeptic admits that if she had a niece or nephew who didnt have the benefit of her economic instruction she would want them to be able to take a class in school But she would want the curriculum to be rolled out on a small scale and tested over time That would then inform how you would want to change things going forward she says Were not going to have any data until we go out and do something In the meantime I have to believe education works says Hogarth See related Financial literacy online resources for parents children

Economic Education Opening a bank account is a onetime event Were trying to teach kids skills and tools they can apply to any decision they may face going forward Schools can do that without breaking the bank by incorporating financial lessons into other subjects says the CFPB Thats what Colorado schools are doing In fall 2013 the state integrated personal finance into its math and social studies standards which schools are required to teach Melissa Colsman executive director of the teaching and learning unit at the Colorado Department of Education says the move fills an important gap Before the standards were implemented most schools did not take a comprehensive approach to teaching students how to make good financial decisions she says As for lesson style the CFPB and most educators say that handson experiential learning is the way to get through to kids Holly Winter is among them She devised a system for her junior high math and literacy students at Denvers Morgridge Academy where they each owe 1200 a week in play money to rent their desks They earn the funds by coming to class on time and doing their homework and extra credit assignments If they do everything theyre supposed to they end up with a little extra to save toward rewards such as a nohomework pass Mostly though Winter tries not to give prizes I want them to know that it feels really good to be in the black and it feels bad to be in the red says Winter who once struggled with credit card debt And they do They hate going into the red According to Mandell though play money isnt enough The real learning doesnt begin until youre teaching with genuine cash Everyone has to have some skin in the game he says The one type of public school program he supports involves setting up savings accounts for students San Franciscos Kindergarten to College K2C program is a great example Since 2012 San Francisco has put 50 for each kindergartener into a college savings account that parents and others can contribute to The schools are also integrating financial subjects into the childrens math curriculum using the accounts as a teaching tool Educators are watching closely to see what effect the program has on future behaviors In fact experts are all eager for better research on the efficacy of school financial literacy programs Even Harvards Madrian a skeptic admits that if she had a niece or nephew who didnt have the benefit of her economic instruction she would want them to be able to take a class in school But she would want the curriculum to be rolled out on a small scale and tested over time That would then inform how you would want to change things going forward she says Were not going to have any data until we go out and do something In the meantime I have to believe education works says

may be premature experts say an overhaul of your loved ones credit score could save your finances and your relationship When both people in a relationship place the same level of importance on their credit scores they are likely sharing the same priorities and backing those priorities up with behaviors that support them says Denise Hughes a financial coach based in San Carlos California On the flip side when its perceived that one partners credit score is dragging the couples financial prospects down resentment can build in the relationship Hughes adds If you want to make sure you and your partner are on the same financial page these strategies may help the two of you get your credit scores in sync 1 Create a guiltfree zone When credit scores vary sometimes the person with the higher score can feel superior and judge the other person Hughes says Or the person with the lesser score may feel judged whether thats the case or not Its already uncomfortable for the person with the lower score says Brooke Rose a Nevadabased public relations manager Rose should know Im the partner with the notsogood credit she says She lacks a lengthy credit history and admits she made a couple of bad moves right after college When she shared her financial missteps with her fianc he made a challenging situation easier by not dwelling on her past mistakes Together we are solution oriented for better outcomes and not rooted in the couldhave wouldhave shouldhave type of thinking she says If a couple cant get past the fingerpointing consider seeing a money coach or a therapist Hughes suggests 2 Review your scores together Now that so many credit card issuers and websites including this one at myCreditCardscom provide free credit scores its easy to see how you and your partner stack up Get instant free credit scores and review each others together says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch Not only do such sites let you monitor your scores but they provide insight into which factors are having the greatest impact on your scores so you can make a plan to boost them Woroch adds 3 Take a longterm approach Just as there are no quick fixes when it comes to building a relationship there are no quick fixes to rebuilding credit Eliminating debt and paying bills on time are the most effective steps one can take says Karl Hoffman a spokesman for credit counseling company Apprisen The only thing to heal a credit score is time Hoffman says and good money habits Research suggests that the effort is worth it An August 2015 study by the Federal Reserve found that not only are people with higher credit scores more likely to get and stay married but couples with similar credit scores are less apt to part ways 4 Dont go for the bailout If one partner has a tendency to run up credit card bills and the other partner constantly bails him out thats setting up a codependent relationship that can cause problems later If someone cleans things up for you then you dont have the opportunity to learn how to maintain and sustain a good credit score rating Hughes says Instead its important for the person with the lower credit score to take ownership of her financial missteps and strive to do better 5 Use the tagteam approach While you dont want to be your partners financial savior you may be able to help improve his credit score For example adding a partner to a credit card account as an authorized user can help that person establish a credit history Likewise it may make sense for the both of you to put extra money toward one partners debt Woroch says as long as the person who created the debt has amended his or her ways 6 Let the one with the lower score do the financing While it might seem natural to have the person with the best credit score finance any purchases the other partner can use financing as a tool to improve her score by charging something and paying it off quickly Rose is using this strategy to get her score up before she gets married Although I have the cash in hand I have had to finance a few things I didnt need to finance in order to improve my credit she says We financed our new bed in my name and Im also looking to finance my wedding dress 7 Create safeguards for the future There is typically one person in a relationship who is better with money than the other and that person most likely will have the higher score Couples should take advantage of each others strengths Woroch says and the better money handler should take control of debts and credit cards as well as other monthly utilities to ensure that everything is paid on time and in full However that doesnt give the other one permission to put their head in the sand Both parties should stay involved with the household finances so either person could jump in if they had to When a couple is on unequal footing because of their credit their relationship can flourish if they work toward creating a better financial picture together Getting it all on the table is

maintained for 2016 EBITDA expected to be stable in 2016 Disclaimer Pursuant to IAS 17 as it applies to Cegeleases activities leases are now classified as financial leases resulting in an adjustment to the 2014 figures published in the 2014 Reference Document filed with the AMF on March 31 2015 and the 2015 revenue figure published on January 28 2015 Readers should refer to the last annex of this press release for full details of the adjustments All of the figures in this press release reflect the adjustments BOULOGNEBILLANCOURT France March 23 2016 GLOBE NEWSWIRE  Cegedim an innovative technology and services company generated consolidated 2015 revenues from continuing activities of EURO4262 million up 02 like for like and 34 on a reported basis compared with the same period in 2014 A likeforlike decline in Healthcare professionals revenues was offset by growth at the Health Insurance HR and eservices division The Health Insurance HR and eservices division made a significant recovery despite the ongoing migration of clients to SaaS  Cloud formats EBITDA came to EURO785 million in 2015 up 07 compared with the same period in 2014 The improvement was chiefly due to the increase in Health Insurance HR and eservices division and the cost cutting in the Activities not allocated division which were partly offset by the decline at the Healthcare professionals division EBITDA margin amounted to 184 in 2015 compared with 189 a year earlier Robust demand among Cegedims clients for the Groups cloudbased solutions and new Business Process Outsourcing BPO products and services fully validates the decision management made in mid2015 to speed up the shift to cloudbased software offerings and rapidly roll out Cegedims new BPO range During this transitional period revenues and profitability have taken a hit from the significant investments the Group has had to make in human resources and innovation and from the switch to a new method of cost and revenue recognition Even so the numerous innovations the Group brought to market in 2015 enabled it to maintain a stable level of likeforlike revenues For 2016 as it announced on January 28 Cegedim confirms that it expects stable revenues from continuing activities and stable EBITDA Further out Cegedim will enjoy greater customer loyalty closer client relationships simpler operating processes more robust offerings and stronger geographic positions The changes now under way will also boost the share of recurring revenues improve sales growth and predictability and enhance the Groups profitability In January 2016 the Group took out a new fiveyear Revolving Credit Facility RCF of EURO200 million This facility combined with the proceeds of the deal with IMS Health will allow the Group to redeem the entire 675 2020 bond issue on April 1 2016 if market conditions permit Following the redemption the Groups pro forma financial charges excluding the early bond redemption premium will decrease by

its creation in 2001 leading to its lease contracts being reclassified as financial lease contracts in accordance with IAS 17 As a result Cegedims 2014 financial statements and 2015 revenues have been restated The full details of the restatements are provided in the appendix Moreover as Cegelease now represents less than 10 of Group revenues and consolidated EBITDA it has been transferred back to the Health Professionals division Finally in March 2015 Cegedim Kadrige was classified as an activity held for sale Thus the impact of this activity is presented in separate lines of the income statement and the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with IFRS 5 In 2015 Cegedim posted consolidated revenues from continuing activities of EURO4262 million up 24 on a reported basis Excluding a favorable currency translation effect of 22 and a 09 boost from acquisitions revenues rose 02 In likeforlike terms the drop at the Healthcare professionals division was offset by growth at the Health Insurance HR and eservices and Activities not allocated divisions EBITDA rose EURO05 million or 07 to EURO785 million The margin dropped marginally from 189 in 2014 to 184 in 2015 The drop in the Healthcare professionals divisions EBITDA was offset by substantial growth at the Health Insurance HR and eservices and Activities not allocated divisions Depreciation charges rose EURO41 million from EURO263 million in 2014 to EURO304 million in 2015Exceptional items amounted to a EURO67 million charge in 2015 compared with an EURO110 million charge a year earlier The lions share of these charges were linked to reorganization costs at the doctor computerization activity in the UK and fees related to the sale of the CRM and strategic data division to IMS Health EBIT before special items fell EURO36 million year on year or 69 to EURO516 million The margin declined from 125 in 2014 to 113 in 2015 The cost of financial debt fell by EURO69 million from EURO477 million at December 31 2014 to EURO408 million at December 31 2015This decline mainly reflects gains on financial investments and the positive impact of restructuring the Groups bond debt in 2014 and 2015 The tax charge went from an expense of EURO16 million in 2014 to a credit of EURO176 million in 2015 This change is chiefly attributable to the booking of a deferred tax asset at the end of December 2015 in the amount of EURO20 million corresponding to a projected tax credit over four years linked to the sale of the CRM and strategic data division to IMS Health Thus the consolidated net result from continuing activities came to a profit of EURO195 million at endDecember 2015 compared with a loss of EURO1922 million over yearearlier period Earnings per share from continuing activities before exceptional items amounted to a profit of EURO16 at endSeptember 2015 compared with a loss of EURO02 at endSeptember 2014 The Group share of consolidated net result was a profit of EURO670 million at endSeptember 2015 compared with a loss of EURO1997 million at endSeptember 2014This profit was the result of an adjustment to the proceeds of the divestment see note 33 in the appendix to the consolidated financial statements Earnings per share were a profit of EURO48 in 2015 compared with a EURO143 loss a year earlier Analysis of business trends by division Key figures by division Revenue EBIT before

basis The July 2015 acquisition of Activus in the UK made a positive contribution of 17 Currencies had virtually no impact Likeforlike revenues rose 44 over the period The Health insurance HR and eservices division represented 551 of consolidated revenues from continuing activities compared with 537 over the same period a year earlier EBITDA came to EURO465 million in 2015 an increase of EURO28 million or 64 The EBITDA margin was stable year on year at 198 The increase in EBITDA was mainly attributable to Cegedim Insurance Solutions which despite the negative shortterm impact of shifting part of its offering to a cloud format benefitted from a good showing by the business that manages thirdparty payment flows This division was also bolstered by the acquisition of Activus last July RNP the specialist in traditional and digital displays for pharmacy windows in France which improved its profitability by successfully navigating the transition to digital This improvement was offset by a temporary decline in profitability at Cegedim SRH owing to the start of operations with new BPO clients Healthcare professionals The divisions 2015 revenues came to EURO1872 million up 01 on a reported basis Currency effects made a positive contribution of 49 There was virtually no impact from acquisitions or divestments Likeforlike revenues fell 48 over the period The Healthcare professionals division represented 438 of consolidated revenues from continuing activities compared with 454 over the same period a year earlier EBITDA came to EURO300 million in 2015 down EURO90 million or 231 compared with the same period in 2014 The EBITDA margin came to 160 vs 209 a year earlier The decline in EBITDA was chiefly attributable to investments made to ensure future growth The Group was penalized by the investments it made in The UK where it aims to have a cloudbased offering for UK doctors by the end of the year The US where it plans to roll out a Revenue Cycle Management RCM offering that will allow it to handle the process of obtaining reimbursement from the various US insurance companies on behalf of doctors The RCM offering is a BPOtype offering and so requires human resources investments when a new client comes on board These investments were partly offset by EBITDA growth in the segments of computerization for nurses and physical therapists in France and at the medication database Base Claude Bernard Activities not allocated The divisions 2015 revenues came to EURO42 million up 78 on a reported basis and like for like There were no currency effects and no acquisitions or divestments The Activities not allocated division represented 10 of consolidated revenues from continuing activities compared with 09 over the same period a year earlier EBITDA improved by EURO68 million to a profit of EURO20 million compared with a yearearlier loss of EURO48 million This brought the margin to 474 at endSeptember 2015 The favorable EBITDA trend reflects the impact of cost reduction efforts and the invoice of IT services to IMS Health Financial resources At December 31 2015 Cegedims total balance sheet amounted to EURO8643 million Acquisition goodwill represented EURO1885 million at December 31 2015 compared with EURO1754 million at end2014The increase of EURO132 million is mainly attributable to the Activus acquisition in July 2015 in the UK and to the appreciation of certain currencies against the euro  most significantly the British Pound  for EURO19 million Acquisition goodwill represented 218 of the total balance sheet at December 31 2015 compared with 149 on December 31 2014 Cash and equivalents came to EURO2313 million at December 31 2015 an increase of EURO1873 million compared with December 31 2014The increase was principally due to the reception of the proceeds from the sale of CRM and strategic data to IMS Health minus the cash held by the divested activities totaling EURO339 million This was partly offset by the redemption on the market of the 675 2020 bond for a total cost of EURO937 million and an increase in the working capital requirement Shareholders equity increased by EURO113 million to EURO2281 million at December 31 2015 compared with EURO2168 million at December 31 2014 The change was chiefly attributable to a smaller translation difference due to the change in scope related to the divestment of the CRM and strategic data business to IMS Health offset by an increase in the Group result Shareholders equity represented 185 of the total balance sheet at endDecember 2014 compared with 264 at endSeptember 2015 Net financial debt amounted to EURO1676 million at endDecember 2015 down EURO3365 million compared with a year earlier It represented 735 of Group shareholders equity at December 31 2015 Before the cost of net financial debt and taxes cash flow was EURO760 million at December 31 2015 compared with EURO1303 million at December 31 2014 Period highlights Sale of the CRM and strategic data division to IMS Health On April 1 2015 Cegedim announced the completion of the sale of its CRM and strategic data division to IMS Health The definitive sale price came to EURO4105

Activus one of the UKs leading suppliers of health and protection insurance software This deal gives Cegedim Health Insurance access to new markets UK US Middle East APAC Africa etc and strengthens its software offering for international clients Activus generated revenue of around EURO7 million in 2014 This move is part of the Groups strategy of making bolton acquisitions to expand its international positions The deal was financed with internal financing It began contributing to Cegedims consolidated results starting from the acquisition date Favorable exchange rate movements At endDecember movements in exchange rates were positive contributing EURO92 million to consolidated 2015 revenues from continuing activities Competition Authority On September 24 2015 the Paris Court of

accounting treatment of the finance lease business in the group consolidated financial statement Cegelease is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cegedim which offers since 2001 financing options through a variety of contracts dedicated to pharmacies and healthcare professionals in France Initially these solutions were aimed at serving the pharmacists who preferred leasing instead of paying upfront the pharmacies management system software that they bought from the Cegedim group As time passed Cegelease diversified its activities Starting as the exclusive finance lease provider for Cegedim group products Cegelease converted to a broker proposing a variety of leasing solutions for group products as well as products developed by third parties offered to a variety of clients including clients who are not already in business with other group entities After the sale of its CRM and strategic data business to IMS Health Cegedim investigated in depth these activities and found that they had to be reclassified according to the following three categories which implied accounting corrections  The Cegedim Group buys the equipment and leases it to the client Accounting treatment These contracts are finance leases according to the IAS 17 accounting standard since all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financed assets are transferred Paragraph  37 of IAS 17 states that the lease payment receivable is treated as repayment of principal and as finance income to reward the finance service In the balance sheet Fixed assets are replaced by a receivable which accounts for the present value of the lease payments This receivable is classified as an operating cash flow item considering that the finance lease business is prolonging the usual operations of the Healthcare professionals sector of the Group In the profit and loss statement The financial income which rewards the finance service is accounted for over the lease duration This income is recognized based on the difference between the amortization charges which are neutralized as are the fixed assets in the balance sheet and the lease payments received which are withdrawn from the consolidated revenue according to IAS 17 This financial income is classified as consolidated revenue considering that the finance lease business is part of the operating business of the Group Moreover when the lease contract relates to an equipment manufactured by a Cegedim Group entity the consolidated revenue includes the value of the outright sale of the leased equipment at the normal selling price IAS 17  43 b Correction implied on the 2014 financial statements and 2015 revenue formerly published The balance sheet was already aligned with IAS 17 Only the PL was corrected The correction has no impact on EBIT but the aggregates composing EBIT varied revenue was corrected downward as well as operating expenses including amortization charges thus impacting EBITDA compared to formerly published figures  The Cegedim Group buys the equipment and leases it and then sells the lease agreement to a bank The bank entitles the Group to manage the process of collecting the lease payments on its behalf Accounting treatment According to the IAS 39 accounting standard these contracts are treated as a financial asset transfer qualifying for derecognition since all the risks of ownership are transferred to the bank institution In the balance sheet The balance sheet is not impacted by these transactions since the lease setup and the lease transfer occur simultaneously and also because the lease transfer qualifies for derecognition In the profit and loss statement The financial income which rewards the finance service is accounted for over the lease duration This income is recognized based on the difference between the lease payments paid to the bank withdrawn from the operating expenses and the lease payments received from the clients withdrawn from the consolidated revenue according to IAS 17 This financial income is classified as consolidated revenue considering that the finance lease business is part of the operating business of the Group Moreover when the lease contract relates to an equipment manufactured by a Cegedim Group entity the consolidated revenue includes the value of the outright sale of the leased equipment at the normal selling price IAS 17  43 b Correction implied on the 2014 financial statements and 2015 revenue formerly published This type of lease was reflected in consolidation similarly as in individual financial statements The correction consists of applying the accounting treatments as described above The correction has no impact on EBIT nor on EBITDA but the aggregates composing EBIT consolidated revenue and operating expenses vary   Cegelease buys the equipment and sells it to a bank selling transaction The bank then leases the equipment to Cegelease who subleases this equipment to the client lease and sublease transactions Accounting treatment According to the IAS 39 accounting standard these contracts are treated as a financial asset transfer notqualifying for derecognition since all the risks of ownership remain with the Cegedim Group In the balance sheet A receivable asset and a payable debt are recognized in the balance sheet and respectively account for the present value of the lease payments to collect from the clients or to pay to the bank These receivable and payable are classified as operating cash flow items considering that the finance lease business is prolonging the usual operations of the Healthcare professionals sector of the Group In the profit and loss statement The flows of income or expenses relating to these contracts are accounted for over the lease duration and are included in the operating income considering that the finance lease business is part of the operating business of the Group Income flows are recognized as consolidated revenue and are calculated based on the difference between the lease payments collected and the variation of the asset receivable over the year Expense flows are recognized as operating expenses and are calculated based on the difference between the lease payments to pay to the bank and the variation of the debt payable over the year Moreover when the lease contract relates to an equipment manufactured by a Cegedim Group entity the consolidated revenue includes the value of the outright sale of the leased equipment at the normal selling price IAS 17  43 b Correction implied on the 2014 financial statements and 2015 revenue formerly published This type of lease was reflected in consolidation similarly as in individual financial statements The correction consists of applying the accounting treatments as described above The correction has no impact on EBIT nor on EBITDA but the aggregates composing EBIT consolidated revenue and operating expenses vary Impacts on numbers as formerly published within the 2014 consolidated financial statements and 2015

28 January 2016 the Cegedim Group decided to sell the Cegedim Kadrige activities These activities are thus isolated in separate lines of the profit and loss statement and balance sheet according to the IFRS 5 accounting standard 2 The correct accounting treatment of the Cegelease finance lease business for all types of contracts selffinanced sold except process management or backed against a bank requires a correction of the consolidated revenue of 82 MEURO downward compared to the initial press release dated 28 January 2016 3 The consolidated revenue recognized for the finance lease business amounts to 10 MEURO and 25 MEURO are added when the lease contract relates to an equipment manufactured by a Cegedim Group entity ie a total of 35 MEURO sitting in the  division of the Group

company generated consolidated 2015 revenues from continuing activities of EURO4262 million up 02 like for like and 34 on a reported basis compared with the same period in 2014 A likeforlike decline in Healthcare professionals revenues was offset by growth at the Health Insurance HR and eservices division The Health Insurance HR and eservices division made a significant recovery despite the ongoing migration of clients to SaaS  Cloud formats EBITDA came to EURO785 million in 2015 up 07 compared with the same period in 2014 The improvement was chiefly due to the increase in Health Insurance HR and eservices division and the cost cutting in the Activities not allocated division which were partly offset by the decline at the Healthcare professionals division EBITDA margin amounted to 184 in 2015 compared with 189 a year earlier Robust demand among Cegedims clients for the Groups cloudbased solutions and new Business Process Outsourcing BPO products and services fully validates the decision management made in mid2015 to speed up the shift to cloudbased software offerings and rapidly roll out Cegedims new BPO range During this transitional period revenues and profitability have taken a hit from the significant investments the Group has had to make in human resources and innovation and from the switch to a new method of cost and revenue recognition Even so the numerous innovations the Group brought to market in 2015 enabled it to maintain a stable level of likeforlike revenues For 2016 as it announced on January 28 Cegedim confirms that it expects stable revenues from continuing activities and stable EBITDA Further out Cegedim will enjoy greater customer loyalty closer client relationships simpler operating processes more robust offerings and stronger geographic positions The changes now under way will also boost the share of recurring revenues improve sales growth and predictability and enhance the Groups profitability In January 2016 the Group took out a new fiveyear Revolving Credit Facility RCF of EURO200 million This facility combined with the proceeds of the deal with IMS Health will allow the Group to redeem the entire 675 2020 bond issue on April 1 2016 if market conditions permit Following the redemption the Groups pro forma financial charges excluding the early bond redemption premium will decrease by around ninefold

full details of the restatements are provided in the appendix Moreover as Cegelease now represents less than 10 of Group revenues and consolidated EBITDA it has been transferred back to the Health Professionals division Finally in March 2015 Cegedim Kadrige was classified as an activity held for sale Thus the impact of this activity is presented in separate lines of the income statement and the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with IFRS 5 In 2015 Cegedim posted consolidated revenues from continuing activities of EURO4262 million up 24 on a reported basis Excluding a favorable currency translation effect of 22 and a 09 boost from acquisitions revenues rose 02 In likeforlike terms the drop at the Healthcare professionals division was offset by growth at the Health Insurance HR and eservices and Activities not allocated divisions EBITDA rose EURO05 million or 07 to EURO785 million The margin dropped marginally from 189 in 2014 to 184 in 2015 The drop in the Healthcare professionals divisions EBITDA was offset by substantial growth at the Health Insurance HR and eservices and Activities not allocated divisions Depreciation charges rose EURO41 million from EURO263 million in 2014 to EURO304 million in 2015Exceptional items amounted to a EURO67 million charge in 2015 compared with an EURO110 million charge a year earlier The lions share of these charges were linked to reorganization costs at the doctor computerization activity in the UK and fees related to the sale of the CRM and strategic data division to IMS Health EBIT before special items fell EURO36 million year on year or 69 to EURO516 million The margin declined from 125 in 2014 to 113 in 2015 The cost of financial debt fell by EURO69 million from EURO477 million at December 31 2014 to EURO408 million at December 31 2015This decline mainly reflects gains on financial investments and the positive impact of restructuring the Groups bond debt in 2014 and 2015 The tax charge went from an expense of EURO16 million in 2014 to a credit of EURO176 million in 2015 This change is chiefly attributable to the booking of a deferred tax asset at the end of December 2015 in the amount of EURO20 million corresponding to a projected tax credit over four years linked to the sale of the CRM and strategic data division to IMS Health Thus the consolidated net result from continuing activities came to a profit of EURO195 million at endDecember 2015 compared with a loss of EURO1922 million over yearearlier period Earnings per share from continuing activities before exceptional items amounted to a profit of EURO16 at endSeptember 2015 compared with a loss of EURO02 at endSeptember 2014 The Group share of consolidated net result was a profit of EURO670 million at endSeptember 2015 compared with a loss of EURO1997 million at endSeptember 2014This profit was the result of an adjustment to the proceeds of the divestment see note 33 in the appendix to the consolidated financial statements Earnings per share were a profit of EURO48 in 2015 compared with a EURO143 loss a year earlier Analysis of business trends by division Key figures by division Revenue EBIT before special items EBITDA

acquisition of Activus in the UK made a positive contribution of 17 Currencies had virtually no impact Likeforlike revenues rose 44 over the period The Health insurance HR and eservices division represented 551 of consolidated revenues from continuing activities compared with 537 over the same period a year earlier EBITDA came to EURO465 million in 2015 an increase of EURO28 million or 64 The EBITDA margin was stable year on year at 198 The increase in EBITDA was mainly attributable to Cegedim Insurance Solutions which despite the negative shortterm impact of shifting part of its offering to a cloud format benefitted from a good showing by the business that manages thirdparty payment flows This division was also bolstered by the acquisition of Activus last July RNP the specialist in traditional and digital displays for pharmacy windows in France which improved its profitability by successfully navigating the transition to digital This improvement was offset by a temporary decline in profitability at Cegedim SRH owing to the start of operations with new BPO clients Healthcare professionals The divisions 2015 revenues came to EURO1872 million up 01 on a reported basis Currency effects made a positive contribution of 49 There was virtually no impact from acquisitions or divestments Likeforlike revenues fell 48 over the period The Healthcare professionals division represented 438 of consolidated revenues from continuing activities compared with 454 over the same period a year earlier EBITDA came to EURO300 million in 2015 down EURO90 million or 231 compared with the same period in 2014 The EBITDA margin came to 160 vs 209 a year earlier The decline in EBITDA was chiefly attributable to investments made to ensure future growth The Group was penalized by the investments it made in The UK where it aims to have a cloudbased offering for UK doctors by the end of the year The US where it plans to roll out a Revenue Cycle Management RCM offering that will allow it to handle the process of obtaining reimbursement from the various US insurance companies on behalf of doctors The RCM offering is a BPOtype offering and so requires human resources investments when a new client comes on board These investments were partly offset by EBITDA growth in the segments of computerization for nurses and physical therapists in France and at the medication database Base Claude Bernard Activities not allocated The divisions 2015 revenues came to EURO42 million up 78 on a reported basis and like for like There were no currency effects and no acquisitions or divestments The Activities not allocated division represented 10 of consolidated revenues from continuing activities compared with 09 over the same period a year earlier EBITDA improved by EURO68 million to a profit of EURO20 million compared with a yearearlier loss of EURO48 million This brought the margin to 474 at endSeptember 2015 The favorable EBITDA trend reflects the impact of cost reduction efforts and the invoice of IT services to IMS Health Financial resources At December 31 2015 Cegedims total balance sheet amounted to EURO8643 million Acquisition goodwill represented EURO1885 million at December 31 2015 compared with EURO1754 million at end2014The increase of EURO132 million is mainly attributable to the Activus acquisition in July 2015 in the UK and to the appreciation of certain currencies against the euro  most significantly the British Pound  for EURO19 million Acquisition goodwill represented 218 of the total balance sheet at December 31 2015 compared with 149 on December 31 2014 Cash and equivalents came to EURO2313 million at December 31 2015 an increase of EURO1873 million compared with December 31 2014The increase was principally due to the reception of the proceeds from the sale of CRM and strategic data to IMS Health minus the cash held by the divested activities totaling EURO339 million This was partly offset by the redemption on the market of the 675 2020 bond for a total cost of EURO937 million and an increase in the working capital requirement Shareholders equity increased by EURO113 million to EURO2281 million at December 31 2015 compared with EURO2168 million at December 31 2014 The change was chiefly attributable to a smaller translation difference due to the change in scope related to the divestment of the CRM and strategic data business to IMS Health offset by an increase in the Group result Shareholders equity represented 185 of the total balance sheet at endDecember 2014 compared with 264 at endSeptember 2015 Net financial debt amounted to EURO1676 million at endDecember 2015 down EURO3365 million compared with a year earlier It represented 735 of Group shareholders equity at December 31 2015 Before the cost of net financial debt and taxes cash flow was EURO760 million at December 31 2015 compared with EURO1303 million at December 31 2014 Period highlights Sale of the CRM and strategic data division to IMS Health On April 1 2015

half of 2014 the Group cancelled factoring agreements covering the divestment of client receivables with no possibility of recourse for a total of EURO380 million These agreements amounted to EURO142

insurance software This deal gives Cegedim Health Insurance access to new markets UK US Middle East APAC Africa etc and strengthens its software offering for international clients Activus generated revenue of around EURO7 million in 2014 This move is part of the Groups strategy of making bolton acquisitions to expand its international positions The deal was financed with internal financing It began contributing to Cegedims consolidated results starting from the acquisition date Favorable exchange rate movements At endDecember movements in exchange rates were positive contributing EURO92 million to consolidated 2015 revenues from continuing activities Competition Authority On September 24 2015 the Paris Court of Appeal rejected Cegedims request and upheld the Competition Authority decision of July 8 2014 Because the fine was paid in full in September 2014 this decision has no impact on Cegedims accounts Cegedim has appealed this decision to the Court of Cassation Acquisition of

the group consolidated financial statement Cegelease is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cegedim which offers since 2001 financing options through a variety of contracts dedicated to pharmacies and healthcare professionals in France Initially these solutions were aimed at serving the pharmacists who preferred leasing instead of paying upfront the pharmacies management system software that they bought from the Cegedim group As time passed Cegelease diversified its activities Starting as the exclusive finance lease provider for Cegedim group products Cegelease converted to a broker proposing a variety of leasing solutions for group products as well as products developed by third parties offered to a variety of clients including clients who are not already in business with other group entities After the sale of its CRM and strategic data business to IMS Health Cegedim investigated in depth these activities and found that they had to be reclassified according to the following three categories which implied accounting corrections  The Cegedim Group buys the equipment and leases it to the client Accounting treatment These contracts are finance leases according to the IAS 17 accounting standard since all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financed assets are transferred Paragraph  37 of IAS 17 states that the lease payment receivable is treated as repayment of principal and as finance income to reward the finance service In the balance sheet Fixed assets are replaced by a receivable which accounts for the present value of the lease payments This receivable is classified as an operating cash flow item considering that the finance lease business is prolonging the usual operations of the Healthcare professionals sector of the Group In the profit and loss statement The financial income which rewards the finance service is accounted for over the lease duration This income is recognized based on the difference between the amortization charges which are neutralized as are the fixed assets in the balance sheet and the lease payments received which are withdrawn from the consolidated revenue according to IAS 17 This financial income is classified as consolidated revenue considering that the finance lease business is part of the operating business of the Group Moreover when the lease contract relates to an equipment manufactured by a Cegedim Group entity the consolidated revenue includes the value of the outright sale of the leased equipment at the normal selling price IAS 17  43 b Correction implied on the 2014 financial statements and 2015 revenue formerly published The balance sheet was already aligned with IAS 17 Only the PL was corrected The correction has no impact on EBIT but the aggregates composing EBIT varied revenue was corrected downward as well as operating expenses including amortization charges thus impacting EBITDA compared to formerly published figures  The Cegedim Group buys the equipment and leases it and then sells the lease agreement to a bank The bank entitles the Group to manage the process of collecting the lease payments on its behalf Accounting treatment According to the IAS 39 accounting standard these contracts are treated as a financial asset transfer qualifying for derecognition since all the risks of ownership are transferred to the bank institution In the balance sheet The balance sheet is not impacted by these transactions since the lease setup and the lease transfer occur simultaneously and also because the lease transfer qualifies for derecognition In the profit and loss statement The financial income which rewards the finance service is accounted for over the lease duration This income is recognized based on the difference between the lease payments paid to the bank withdrawn from the operating expenses and the lease payments received from the clients withdrawn from the consolidated revenue according to IAS 17 This financial income is classified as consolidated revenue considering that the finance lease business is part of the operating business of the Group Moreover when the lease contract relates to an equipment manufactured by a Cegedim Group entity the consolidated revenue includes the value of the outright sale of the leased equipment at the normal selling price IAS 17  43 b Correction implied on the 2014 financial statements and 2015 revenue formerly published This type of lease was reflected in consolidation similarly as in individual financial statements The correction consists of applying the accounting treatments as described above The correction has no impact on EBIT nor on EBITDA but the aggregates composing EBIT consolidated revenue and operating expenses vary   Cegelease buys the equipment and sells it to a bank selling transaction The bank then leases the equipment to Cegelease who subleases this equipment to the client lease and sublease transactions Accounting treatment According to the IAS 39 accounting standard these contracts are treated as a financial asset transfer notqualifying for derecognition since all the risks of ownership remain with the Cegedim Group In the balance sheet A receivable asset and a payable debt are recognized in the balance sheet and respectively account for the present value of the lease payments to collect from the clients or to pay to the bank These receivable and payable are classified as operating cash flow items considering that the finance lease business is prolonging the usual operations of the Healthcare professionals sector of the Group In the profit and loss statement The flows of income or expenses relating to these contracts are accounted for over the lease duration and are included in the operating income considering that the finance lease business is part of the operating business of the Group Income flows are recognized as consolidated revenue and are calculated based on the difference between the lease payments collected and the variation of the asset receivable over the year Expense flows are recognized as operating expenses and are calculated based on the difference between the lease payments to pay to the bank and the variation of the debt payable over the year Moreover when the lease contract relates to an equipment manufactured by a Cegedim Group entity the consolidated revenue includes the value of the outright sale of the leased equipment at the normal selling price IAS 17  43 b Correction implied on the 2014 financial statements and 2015 revenue formerly published This type of lease was reflected in consolidation similarly as in individual financial statements The correction consists of applying the accounting treatments as described above The correction has no impact on EBIT nor on EBITDA but the aggregates composing EBIT consolidated revenue and operating expenses vary Impacts on numbers as formerly published within the 2014 consolidated financial statements and 2015 consolidated revenue

Guidance Forecast gold production for 2016 of approximately 37000 ounces with AllIn Sustaining Cost between US840 to US870 per ounce Post Year End Highlights Approximately 65001 ounces of gold produced during the first two months of 2016 Testing of third ball mill underway Other plant expansion programmes proceeding on schedule Increased plant processing capacity expected to be operational from 1 May 2016 Operational Highlights The final quarter of 2015 recorded 79251 ounces of gold production giving a yearend total of 326291 ounces Combined mill throughput for the fourth quarter for both Palito and Sao Chico ore totalled 34848 tonnes with 130299 tonnes being milled for the year A total of 9598 metres of horizontal development across both mining operation was achieved for the year At the end of the fourth quarter surface stockpiles at Palito and Sao Chico totalled approximately16000 tonnes at a grade of 47 gt of gold November saw the commissioning of the Gekko intensive leach reactor ILR which works in tandem with the Falcon gravity centrifugal concentrator This equipment is working exclusively on the Sao Chico feed to recover gravity gold Installation of the third ball mill is well underway and this along with improvements in the flotation and CIP process circuits are on schedule to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016 A carbon regeneration kiln is also being acquired which will assist in enhancing gold recoveries once the kiln is operational in the second half of the year 1 Gold production figures are subject to amendment pending final agreed assays of the gold content of the coppergold concentrate and gold dore that is delivered to the refineries Palito development Annual mine development was 6928 metres of which 1960 metres was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 Annual mine production was 111751 tonnes at 1005 gt of which 26953 tonnes at 884 gt grammes per tonne gt was produced in the fourth quarter of 2015 Sao Chico development Annual mine development was 2997 metres of which 729 metres was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 Annual mine production was 22096 tonnes at 845 gt of which 7006 tonnes at 976 gt was produced in the fourth quarter of 2015 Sao Chico is now being developed on the 186mRL and 156mRL levels with production on the 199mRL and 186mRL levels The ramp is now being deepened to the 126mRL the next planned development level and will continue this year to the 96mRL to accommodate underground drilling of the Sao Chico deposit extension at depth Mike Hodgson CEO of Serabi commented For what has been our first full year of gold production from Palito 2015 has been a year that I can look back on with great satisfaction at what has been achieved The operational results have been excellent and the financial results show that we have achieved these in a cost effective manner Gold production in 2015 increased from 18000 ounces in 2014 to almost 33000 ounces in 2015 and we are forecasting further production growth for 2016 with Sao Chico now in commercial production We have a current target of 37000 ounces of gold production for this year and with three consecutive months of over 3000 ounces of gold production per month and approximately 6500 ounces produced during first two months of 2016 we are on target to achieve our best quarter What is even more satisfying is that these production levels have been achieved before the plant capacity improvements that we expect to complete for the beginning of May 2016 The financial results for 2015 speak for themselves we have reduced cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce have achieved a gross profit margin of 16 for 2015 and are aiming to have an all in sustaining costs of between US840 to US870 for 2016 I am very optimistic for the next twelve months We have had some welcome respite in the recovery of the gold price during the first quarter and this provides a boost to our cash generation Whilst we remain focussed on optimising the current operations should the improvement in gold prices continue and therefore provide additional cash flow we will be looking later in the year to evaluate some of our mine site discoveries that lie within the existing tenements The potential for resource growth at Palito and Sao Chico is excellent with the advantage that this resource growth can quickly be translated into low cost production growth I would like to take this opportunity to thank the team for all their hard work throughout the period I believe that 2016 will be a good year for Serabi and I look forward to updating shareholders of our continued progress through the year The latest interview with Mike Hodgson discussing the highlights of the 2015 financial year and progress at Palito and Sao Chico can be accessed using the following links httpbrrmediacoukevent141647popuptrue Chairmans Statement Serabi has enjoyed another very successful year in 2015 and continues to make strides towards its objective of becoming a gold producer with its All in Sustaining Cost AISC in the first quartile The Palito Mine exceeded our production expectations for 2015 and tonnage and grades have been in excess of the estimates with in original 2012 Preliminary Economic Assessment I fully expect that this success will continue Commercial production has also now been declared for the Sao Chico Mine and as a consequence 2016 promises to be another year of production growth The year was dominated for Serabi by a falling gold price but as with many emerging market producers the effects were mitigated by the weakness of the local currency It has been a difficult balancing act in what is our first full calendar year of operations to ensure continuity and consistency of operations whilst at the same time seeking to make cost reductions to optimise margins and safeguard the long term profitability of the business Management acknowledge the need to attain a cost base that gives the Group the best chance of dealing with the possibility of an extended period of low gold prices Whilst there has been a rally in the gold price in the early part of 2016 we have in recent years seen similar trends in the first quarter with a subsequent retrenchment over the rest of the year We are therefore far from complacent and will use this windfall as a buffer against the possibility of potential weakening later in the year The euphoria of the highs of 2011 and 2012 are well behind us and we should be grateful that golds traditional place as a safe haven has protected it against the quantum of the price declines seen in many other commodities The pain is however affecting us all and I believe that 2016 will mark a turning point that will see capitulation on the supply side This follows a lack of any new significant projects in the last two years few on the horizon and a period where some existing producers need to defer capital and resort to highgrading their operations to maintain their shortterm viability This supply shortfall should lead to an inevitable adjustment in prices By doing all we can to establish now a long term viable operation with the lowest costs possible I anticipate us being well positioned when this correction takes place Even if it takes longer to manifest itself the Group will be well protected against any further down turn in the market Serabi enjoys the benefit of an experienced management team that has been together for several years The extensive collective operational experience that they have has been a key factor in the ability to bring two mines into production on budget and within a short time frame Serabis management sets it apart from many other junior mining companies and the proven record of efficiently turning projects into cash flow is attracting support for the Group as it seeks further growth opportunities In recent years it has been difficult for mining companies to justify undertaking exploration when it has generally been a cheaper alternative to simply add additional ounces through a corporate acquisition Management have been active in assessing a number of opportunities as it is clearly an excellent time for Serabi to take advantage of the opportunities created by the market weakness However it remains difficult to find the blend of project and price that makes an acquisition compelling Whilst we consider that Serabi needs to grow and make a step change that will be reflected in its valuation the Board will not allow management to pursue opportunities that will not bring strong long term returns to our existing shareholders Of course Serabi has the added advantage of being in a highly prospective area and therefore has numerous organic growth opportunities Whilst it may be difficult to match the resource growth that an acquisition can bring on a cost per ounce basis success with our own exploration land holdings has the benefit of seeing insitu resources quickly transformed onto cash flow Pursing such organic growth creates the opportunity to build around the Palito Mine a significant hub and spoke operation bringing into play a number of small but highly profitable mines with low capital requirements in light of the leverage available from the existing operations This ability to generate production quickly with a low capital outlay is another factor which separates Serabi from many other junior exploration and development peers Whist we are very pleased with the development of Serabi over the last three years the Board is far from complacent We have each experienced the pitfalls associated with mining and the inherent risks that exist in the sector and know that despite all the best planning we can never mitigate all of these Management is constantly challenged to ensure that its plans have flexibility and that it is always seeking to mitigate risks whether geological mechanical social economic or political Only by doing this can we ensure that we have a robust profitable and sustainable business The next twelve months will bring their challenges but also their rewards I am optimistic on the outlook for gold and believe that we have now positioned Serabi to benefit from and grow on the back of it I am confident that the Group will meet or even exceed its targets for the next twelve months and in so doing build a strong financial foundation from which to realise the growth potential that it has On behalf of the board of Directors I would like to extend my appreciation to the employees and management of Serabi for a job well done during difficult times in 2015 Their hard work and determination to succeed has your company well positioned to reap the benefits of the higher gold price environment we expect during 2016 and beyond Finally thank you to our shareholders large and small for your patience during the last few years I believe the future is extremely bright for Serabi Sean Harvey  Chairman Serabis Directors

31 December 2015 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 but is derived from those accounts Whilst the financial information included in this announcement has been compiled in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS this announcement itself does not contain sufficient financial information to comply with IFRS A copy of the statutory accounts for 2014 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2015 will be submitted for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting The full audited financial statements for the years end 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2014 do comply with IFRS 2 Auditors Opinion The auditor has issued an unqualified opinion in respect of the financial statements which does not contain any statements under the Companies Act 2006 Section 4982 or Section 4983 The auditor has raised an Emphasis of Matter in relation to going concern and the availability of project finance as follows In forming our opinion which is not modified we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in Note 1a to the financial statements concerning the groups ability to continue as a going concern Whilst the Group has access to further unsecured loan amounts in the near term these loans must be repaid by 31 January 2017 In order to meet its existing commitments and liabilities as they fall due the Group is dependent on its ability to successfully achieve planned production levels for the year from the Palito and Sao Chico mines the latter of which achieved commercial production on 1 January 2016 There are risks associated with the commencement of a new mining operation and additional working capital may be required to fund unforeseen technical and logistical events should they occur The Group is also susceptible to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates which are outside of its control These conditions along with the other matters explained in Note 1a to the financial statements indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Groups ability to continue as a going concern The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and the Company were unable to continue as a going concern NB The reference to note 1a in the above is a reference to the Basis of preparation note contained within the Financial Statements from which the extract reproduced below referring to Going Concern is taken 3 Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in force at the reporting date and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted for use within the European Union and with IFRS and their interpretations issued by the IASB The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS It is not anticipated that the adoption in the future of the new or revised standards or interpretations that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but are not yet effective will have a material impact on the Groups earnings or shareholders funds The Company has not adopted any new standards in advance of the effective dates Going concern and availability of project finance Having commenced initial development activities for the Sao Chico Mine at the end of 2014 this mine has been in development during 2015 On 1 February 2016 the Group announced that with effect from 1 January 2016 the Sao Chico Mine had achieved Commercial Production The Palito Mine has been in Commercial Production since 1 July 2014 On 30 December 2015 the Group entered into an agreement with Fratelli Investments Ltd Fratelli its major shareholder whereby Fratelli agreed to provide an unsecured short term working capital convertible loan facility of US5 million the Facility to provide additional working capital facilities On 6 January 2016 the Group announced that it had made an initial draw down of US2 million against the Facility The balance of the Facility may be drawdown at any time up to 30 June 2016 The facility is to be repaid by 31 January 2017 The Group has a secured loan facility which is repayable by 31 December 2016 At 31 December 2015 the amount outstanding under this facility was US40 million The Directors anticipate the Group now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate projected needs The Group expects to have sufficient cash flow from its forecast production to finance its ongoing operational requirements to repay its secured and unsecured loan facilities and to at least in part fund exploration and development activity on its other gold properties However the forecasted cash flow projections for the next twelve months include a significant increase in production from the Sao Chico Mine compared with the preceding calendar year Whilst the Group has declared Commercial Production at the Sao Chico Mine there are risks associated with the commencement of any new mining operation whereby unforeseen technical and logistical events result in additional costs needing to be incurred giving rise to the possibility that additional working capital may be required Additionally the Group is exposed to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates Should additional working capital be required the Directors consider that further sources of finance could be secured within the required timescale On this basis the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis However there is no certainty that such additional funds either for working capital or for future development will be forthcoming and these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern 4 Finance Income and expense Group For the For the year ended year ended 31

Loss per Share The calculation of the basic loss per share of 001 cents 2014 loss per share 003 cents is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of US48738 2014 loss of US174401 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 656389204 2014 622964546 in issue during the period Diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share because the exercise of share options would be antidilutive 6 Post balance sheet events On 31 December 2015 the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with Fratelli Investments Ltd Fratelli its major shareholder

produced during the first two months of 2016 Testing of third ball mill underway Other plant expansion programmes proceeding on schedule Increased plant processing capacity expected to be operational from 1 May 2016 Operational Highlights The final quarter of 2015 recorded 79251 ounces of gold production giving a yearend total of 326291 ounces Combined mill throughput for the fourth quarter for both Palito and Sao Chico ore totalled 34848 tonnes with 130299 tonnes being milled for the year A total of 9598 metres of horizontal development across both mining operation was achieved for the year At the end of the fourth quarter surface stockpiles at Palito and Sao Chico totalled approximately16000 tonnes at a grade of 47 gt of gold November saw the commissioning of the Gekko intensive leach reactor ILR which works in tandem with the Falcon gravity centrifugal concentrator This equipment is working exclusively on the Sao Chico feed to recover gravity gold Installation of the third ball mill is well underway and this along with improvements in the flotation and CIP process circuits are on schedule to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016 A carbon regeneration kiln is also being acquired which will assist in enhancing gold recoveries once the kiln is operational in the second half of the year 1 Gold production figures are subject to amendment pending final agreed assays of the gold content of the coppergold concentrate and gold dore that is delivered to the refineries Palito development Annual mine development was 6928 metres of which 1960 metres was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 Annual mine production was 111751 tonnes at 1005 gt of which 26953 tonnes at 884 gt grammes per tonne gt was produced in the fourth quarter of 2015 Sao Chico development Annual mine development was 2997 metres of which 729 metres was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 Annual mine production was 22096 tonnes at 845 gt of which 7006 tonnes at 976 gt was produced in the fourth quarter of 2015 Sao Chico is now being developed on the 186mRL and 156mRL levels with production on the 199mRL and 186mRL levels The ramp is now being deepened to the 126mRL the next planned development level and will continue this year to the 96mRL to accommodate underground drilling of the Sao Chico deposit extension at depth Mike Hodgson CEO of Serabi commented For what has been our first full year of gold production from Palito 2015 has been a year that I can look back on with great satisfaction at what has been achieved The operational results have been excellent and the financial results show that we have achieved these in a cost effective manner Gold production in 2015 increased from 18000 ounces in 2014 to almost 33000 ounces in 2015 and we are forecasting further production growth for 2016 with Sao Chico now in commercial production We have a current target of 37000 ounces of gold production for this year and with three consecutive months of over 3000 ounces of gold production per month and approximately 6500 ounces produced during first two months of 2016 we are on target to achieve our best quarter What is even more satisfying is that these production levels have been achieved before the plant capacity improvements that we expect to complete for the beginning of May 2016 The financial results for 2015 speak for themselves we have reduced cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce have achieved a gross profit margin of 16 for 2015 and are aiming to have an all in sustaining costs of between US840 to US870 for 2016 I am very optimistic for the next twelve months We have had some welcome respite in the recovery of the gold price during the first quarter and this provides a boost to our cash generation Whilst we remain focussed on optimising the current operations should the improvement in gold prices continue and therefore provide additional cash flow we will be looking later in the year to evaluate some of our mine site discoveries that lie within the existing tenements The potential for resource growth at Palito and Sao Chico is excellent with the advantage that this resource growth can quickly be translated into low cost production growth I would like to take this opportunity to thank the team for all their hard work throughout the period I believe that 2016 will be a good year for Serabi and I look forward to updating shareholders of our continued progress through the year The latest interview with Mike Hodgson discussing the highlights of the 2015 financial year and progress at Palito and Sao Chico can be accessed using the following links httpbrrmediacoukevent141647popuptrue Chairmans Statement Serabi has enjoyed another very successful year in 2015 and continues to make strides towards its objective of becoming a gold producer with its All in Sustaining Cost AISC in the first quartile The Palito Mine exceeded our production expectations for 2015 and tonnage and grades have been in excess of the estimates with in original 2012 Preliminary Economic Assessment I fully expect that this success will continue Commercial production has also now been declared for the Sao Chico Mine and as a consequence 2016 promises to be another year of production growth The year was dominated for Serabi by a falling gold price but as with many emerging market producers the effects were mitigated by the weakness of the local currency It has been a difficult balancing act in what is our first full calendar year of operations to ensure continuity and consistency of operations whilst at the same time seeking to make cost reductions to optimise margins and safeguard the long term profitability of the business Management acknowledge the need to attain a cost base that gives the Group the best chance of dealing with the possibility of an extended period of low gold prices Whilst there has been a rally in the gold price in the early part of 2016 we have in recent years seen similar trends in the first quarter with a subsequent retrenchment over the rest of the year We are therefore far from complacent and will use this windfall as a buffer against the possibility of potential weakening later in the year The euphoria of the highs of 2011 and 2012 are well behind us and we should be grateful that golds traditional place as a safe haven has protected it against the quantum of the price declines seen in many other commodities The pain is however affecting us all and I believe that 2016 will mark a turning point that will see capitulation on the supply side This follows a lack of any new significant projects in the last two years few on the horizon and a period where some existing producers need to defer capital and resort to highgrading their operations to maintain their shortterm viability This supply shortfall should lead to an inevitable adjustment in prices By doing all we can to establish now a long term viable operation with the lowest costs possible I anticipate us being well positioned when this correction takes place Even if it takes longer to manifest itself the Group will be well protected against any further down turn in the market Serabi enjoys the benefit of an experienced management team that has been together for several years The extensive collective operational experience that they have has been a key factor in the ability to bring two mines into production on budget and within a short time frame Serabis management sets it apart from many other junior mining companies and the proven record of efficiently turning projects into cash flow is attracting support for the Group as it seeks further growth opportunities In recent years it has been difficult for mining companies to justify undertaking exploration when it has generally been a cheaper alternative to simply add additional ounces through a corporate acquisition Management have been active in assessing a number of opportunities as it is clearly an excellent time for Serabi to take advantage of the opportunities created by the market weakness However it remains difficult to find the blend of project and price that makes an acquisition compelling Whilst we consider that Serabi needs to grow and make a step change that will be reflected in its valuation the Board will not allow management to pursue opportunities that will not bring strong long term returns to our existing shareholders Of course Serabi has the added advantage of being in a highly prospective area and therefore has numerous organic growth opportunities Whilst it may be difficult to match the resource growth that an acquisition can bring on a cost per ounce basis success with our own exploration land holdings has the benefit of seeing insitu resources quickly transformed onto cash flow Pursing such organic growth creates the opportunity to build around the Palito Mine a significant hub and spoke operation bringing into play a number of small but highly profitable mines with low capital requirements in light of the leverage available from the existing operations This ability to generate production quickly with a low capital outlay is another factor which separates Serabi from many other junior exploration and development peers Whist we are very pleased with the development of Serabi over the last three years the Board is far from complacent We have each experienced the pitfalls associated with mining and the inherent risks that exist in the sector and know that despite all the best planning we can never mitigate all of these Management is constantly challenged to ensure that its plans have flexibility and that it is always seeking to mitigate risks whether geological mechanical social economic or political Only by doing this can we ensure that we have a robust profitable and sustainable business The next twelve months will bring their challenges but also their rewards I am optimistic on the outlook for gold and believe that we have now positioned Serabi to benefit from and grow on the back of it I am confident that the Group will meet or even exceed its targets for the next twelve months and in so doing build a strong financial foundation from which to realise the growth potential that it has On behalf of the board of Directors I would like to extend my appreciation to the employees and management of Serabi for a job well done during difficult times in 2015 Their hard work and determination to succeed has your company well positioned to reap the benefits of the higher gold price environment we expect during 2016 and beyond Finally thank you to our shareholders large and small for your patience during the last few years I believe the future is extremely bright for Serabi Sean Harvey  Chairman Serabis Directors

of the statutory accounts for 2014 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2015 will be submitted for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting The full audited financial statements for the years end 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2014 do comply with IFRS 2 Auditors Opinion The auditor has issued an unqualified opinion in respect of the financial statements which does not contain any statements under the Companies Act 2006 Section 4982 or Section 4983 The auditor has raised an Emphasis of Matter in relation to going concern and the availability of project finance as follows In forming our opinion which is not modified we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in Note 1a to the financial statements concerning the groups ability to continue as a going concern Whilst the Group has access to further unsecured loan amounts in the near term these loans must be repaid by 31 January 2017 In order to meet its existing commitments and liabilities as they fall due the Group is dependent on its ability to successfully achieve planned production levels for the year from the Palito and Sao Chico mines the latter of which achieved commercial production on 1 January 2016 There are risks associated with the commencement of a new mining operation and additional working capital may be required to fund unforeseen technical and logistical events should they occur The Group is also susceptible to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates which are outside of its control These conditions along with the other matters explained in Note 1a to the financial statements indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Groups ability to continue as a going concern The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and the Company were unable to continue as a going concern NB The reference to note 1a in the above is a reference to the Basis of preparation note contained within the Financial Statements from which the extract reproduced below referring to Going Concern is taken 3 Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in force at the reporting date and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted for use within the European Union and with IFRS and their interpretations issued by the IASB The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS It is not anticipated that the adoption in the future of the new or revised standards or interpretations that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but are not yet effective will have a material impact on the Groups earnings or shareholders funds The Company has not adopted any new standards in advance of the effective dates Going concern and availability of project finance Having commenced initial development activities for the Sao Chico Mine at the end of 2014 this mine has been in development during 2015 On 1 February 2016 the Group announced that with effect from 1 January 2016 the Sao Chico Mine had achieved Commercial Production The Palito Mine has been in Commercial Production since 1 July 2014 On 30 December 2015 the Group entered into an agreement with Fratelli Investments Ltd Fratelli its major shareholder whereby Fratelli agreed to provide an unsecured short term working capital convertible loan facility of US5 million the Facility to provide additional working capital facilities On 6 January 2016 the Group announced that it had made an initial draw down of US2 million against the Facility The balance of the Facility may be drawdown at any time up to 30 June 2016 The facility is to be repaid by 31 January 2017 The Group has a secured loan facility which is repayable by 31 December 2016 At 31 December 2015 the amount outstanding under this facility was US40 million The Directors anticipate the Group now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate projected needs The Group expects to have sufficient cash flow from its forecast production to finance its ongoing operational requirements to repay its secured and unsecured loan facilities and to at least in part fund exploration and development activity on its other gold properties However the forecasted cash flow projections for the next twelve months include a significant increase in production from the Sao Chico Mine compared with the preceding calendar year Whilst the Group has declared Commercial Production at the Sao Chico Mine there are risks associated with the commencement of any new mining operation whereby unforeseen technical and logistical events result in additional costs needing to be incurred giving rise to the possibility that additional working capital may be required Additionally the Group is exposed to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates Should additional working capital be required the Directors consider that further sources of finance could be secured within the required timescale On this basis the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis However there is no certainty that such additional funds either for working capital or for future development will be forthcoming and these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern 4 Finance Income and expense Group For the For the year ended year ended 31

Loss per Share The calculation of the basic loss per share of 001 cents 2014 loss per share 003 cents is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of US48738 2014 loss of US174401 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 656389204 2014 622964546 in issue during the period Diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share because the exercise of share options would be antidilutive 6 Post balance sheet events On 31 December 2015 the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with Fratelli Investments Ltd Fratelli its major shareholder

mill underway Other plant expansion programmes proceeding on schedule Increased plant processing capacity expected to be operational from 1 May 2016 Operational Highlights The final quarter of 2015 recorded 79251 ounces of gold production giving a yearend total of 326291 ounces Combined mill throughput for the fourth quarter for both Palito and Sao Chico ore totalled 34848 tonnes with 130299 tonnes being milled for the year A total of 9598 metres of horizontal development across both mining operation was achieved for the year At the end of the fourth quarter surface stockpiles at Palito and Sao Chico totalled approximately16000 tonnes at a grade of 47 gt of gold November saw the commissioning of the Gekko intensive leach reactor ILR which works in tandem with the Falcon gravity centrifugal concentrator This equipment is working exclusively on the Sao Chico feed to recover gravity gold Installation of the third ball mill is well underway and this along with improvements in the flotation and CIP process circuits are on schedule to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016 A carbon regeneration kiln is also being acquired which will assist in enhancing gold recoveries once the kiln is operational in the second half of the year 1 Gold production figures are subject to amendment pending final agreed assays of the gold content of the coppergold concentrate and gold dore that is delivered to the refineries Palito development Annual mine development was 6928 metres of which 1960 metres was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 Annual mine production was 111751 tonnes at 1005 gt of which 26953 tonnes at 884 gt grammes per tonne gt was produced in the fourth quarter of 2015 Sao Chico development Annual mine development was 2997 metres of which 729

developed on the 186mRL and 156mRL levels with production on the 199mRL and 186mRL levels The ramp is now being deepened to the 126mRL the next planned development level and will continue this year to the 96mRL to accommodate underground drilling of the Sao Chico deposit extension at depth Mike Hodgson CEO of Serabi commented For what has been our first full year of gold production from Palito 2015 has been a year that I can look back on with great satisfaction at what has been achieved The operational results have been excellent and the financial results show that we have achieved these in a cost effective manner Gold production in 2015 increased from 18000 ounces in 2014 to almost 33000 ounces in 2015 and we are forecasting further production growth for 2016 with Sao Chico now in commercial production We have a current target of 37000 ounces of gold production for this year and with three consecutive months of over 3000 ounces of gold production per month and approximately 6500 ounces produced during first two months of 2016 we are on target to achieve our best quarter What is even more satisfying is that these production levels have been achieved before the plant capacity improvements that we expect to complete for the beginning of May 2016 The financial results for 2015 speak for themselves we have reduced cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce have achieved a gross profit margin of 16 for 2015 and are aiming to have an all in sustaining costs of between US840 to US870 for 2016 I am very optimistic for the next twelve months We have had some welcome respite in the recovery of the gold price during the first quarter and this provides a boost to our cash generation Whilst we remain focussed on optimising the current operations should the improvement in gold prices continue and therefore provide additional cash flow we will be looking later in the year to evaluate some of our mine site discoveries that lie within the existing tenements The potential for resource growth at Palito and Sao Chico is excellent with the advantage that this resource growth can quickly be translated into low cost production growth I would like to take this opportunity to thank the team for all their hard work throughout the period I believe that 2016 will be a good year for Serabi and I look forward to updating shareholders of our continued progress through the year The latest interview with Mike Hodgson discussing the highlights of the 2015 financial year and progress at Palito and Sao Chico can be accessed using the following links httpbrrmediacoukevent141647popuptrue Chairmans Statement Serabi has enjoyed another very successful year in 2015 and continues to make strides towards its objective of becoming a gold producer with its All in Sustaining Cost AISC in the first quartile The Palito Mine exceeded our production expectations for 2015 and tonnage and grades have been in excess of the estimates with in original 2012 Preliminary Economic Assessment I fully expect that this success will continue Commercial production has also now been declared for the Sao Chico Mine and as a consequence 2016 promises to be another year of production growth The year was dominated for Serabi by a falling gold price but as with many emerging market producers the effects were mitigated by the weakness of the local currency It has been a difficult balancing act in what is our first full calendar year of operations to ensure continuity and consistency of operations whilst at the same time seeking to make cost reductions to optimise margins and safeguard the long term profitability of the business Management acknowledge the need to attain a cost base that gives the Group the best chance of dealing with the possibility of an extended period of low gold prices Whilst there has been a rally in the gold price in the early part of 2016 we have in recent years seen similar trends in the first quarter with a subsequent retrenchment over the rest of the year We are therefore far from complacent and will use this windfall as a buffer against the possibility of potential weakening later in the year The euphoria of the highs of 2011 and 2012 are well behind us and we should be grateful that golds traditional place as a safe haven has protected it against the quantum of the price declines seen in many other commodities The pain is however affecting us all and I believe that 2016 will mark a turning point that will see capitulation on the supply side This follows a lack of any new significant projects in the last two years few on the horizon and a period where some existing producers need to defer capital and resort to highgrading their operations to maintain their shortterm viability This supply shortfall should lead to an inevitable adjustment in prices By doing all we can to establish now a long term viable operation with the lowest costs possible I anticipate us being well positioned when this correction takes place Even if it takes longer to manifest itself the Group will be well protected against any further down turn in the market Serabi enjoys the benefit of an experienced management team that has been together for several years The extensive collective operational experience that they have has been a key factor in the ability to bring two mines into production on budget and within a short time frame Serabis management sets it apart from many other junior mining companies and the proven record of efficiently turning projects into cash flow is attracting support for the Group as it seeks further growth opportunities In recent years it has been difficult for mining companies to justify undertaking exploration when it has generally been a cheaper alternative to simply add additional ounces through a corporate acquisition Management have been active in assessing a number of opportunities as it is clearly an excellent time for Serabi to take advantage of the opportunities created by the market weakness However it remains difficult to find the blend of project and price that makes an acquisition compelling Whilst we consider that Serabi needs to grow and make a step change that will be reflected in its valuation the Board will not allow management to pursue opportunities that will not bring strong long term returns to our existing shareholders Of course Serabi has the added advantage of being in a highly prospective area and therefore has numerous organic growth opportunities Whilst it may be difficult to match the resource growth that an acquisition can bring on a cost per ounce basis success with our own exploration land holdings has the benefit of seeing insitu resources quickly transformed onto cash flow Pursing such organic growth creates the opportunity to build around the Palito Mine a significant hub and spoke operation bringing into play a number of small but highly profitable mines with low capital requirements in light of the leverage available from the existing operations This ability to generate production quickly with a low capital outlay is another factor which separates Serabi from many other junior exploration and development peers Whist we are very pleased with the development of Serabi over the last three years the Board is far from complacent We have each experienced the pitfalls associated with mining and the inherent risks that exist in the sector and know that despite all the best planning we can never mitigate all of these Management is constantly challenged to ensure that its plans have flexibility and that it is always seeking to mitigate risks whether geological mechanical social economic or political Only by doing this can we ensure that we have a robust profitable and sustainable business The next twelve months will bring their challenges but also their rewards I am optimistic on the outlook for gold and believe that we have now positioned Serabi to benefit from and grow on the back of it I am confident that the Group will meet or even exceed its targets for the next twelve months and in so doing build a strong financial foundation from which to realise the growth potential that it has On behalf of the board of Directors I would like to extend my appreciation to the employees and management of Serabi for a job well done during difficult times in 2015 Their hard work and determination to succeed has your company well positioned to reap the benefits of the higher gold price environment we expect during 2016 and beyond Finally thank you to our shareholders large and small for your patience during the last few years I believe the future is extremely bright for Serabi Sean Harvey  Chairman Serabis Directors Report and Financial Statements for the year

Notes 1 General Information The financial information set out above for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2015 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 but is derived from those accounts Whilst the financial information included in this announcement has been compiled in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS this announcement itself does not contain sufficient financial information to comply with IFRS A copy of the statutory accounts for 2014 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2015 will be submitted for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting The full audited financial statements for the years end 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2014 do comply with IFRS 2 Auditors Opinion The auditor has issued an unqualified opinion in respect of the financial statements which does not contain any statements under the Companies Act 2006 Section 4982 or Section 4983 The auditor has raised an Emphasis of Matter in relation to going concern and the availability of project finance as follows In forming our opinion which is not modified we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in Note 1a to the financial statements concerning the groups ability to continue as a going concern Whilst the Group has access to further unsecured loan amounts in the near term these loans must be repaid by 31 January 2017 In order to meet its existing commitments and liabilities as they fall due the Group is dependent on its ability to successfully achieve planned production levels for the year from the Palito and Sao Chico mines the latter of which achieved commercial production on 1 January 2016 There are risks associated with the commencement of a new mining operation and additional working capital may be required to fund unforeseen technical and logistical events should they occur The Group is also susceptible to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates which are outside of its control These conditions along with the other matters explained in Note 1a to the financial statements indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Groups ability to continue as a going concern The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and the Company were unable to continue as a going concern NB The reference to note 1a in the above is a reference to the Basis of preparation note contained within the Financial Statements from which the extract reproduced below referring to Going Concern is taken 3 Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in force at the reporting date and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted for use within the European Union and with IFRS and their interpretations issued by the IASB The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS It is not anticipated that the adoption in the future of the new or revised standards or interpretations that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but are not yet effective will have a material impact on the Groups earnings or shareholders funds The Company has not adopted any new standards in advance of the effective dates Going concern and availability of project finance Having commenced initial development activities for the Sao Chico Mine at the end of 2014 this mine has been in development during 2015 On 1 February 2016 the Group announced that with effect from 1 January 2016 the Sao Chico Mine had achieved Commercial Production The Palito Mine has been in Commercial Production since 1 July 2014 On 30 December 2015 the Group entered into an agreement with Fratelli Investments Ltd Fratelli its major shareholder whereby Fratelli agreed to provide an unsecured short term working capital convertible loan facility of US5 million the Facility to provide additional working capital facilities On 6 January 2016 the Group announced that it had made an initial draw down of US2 million against the Facility The balance of the Facility may be drawdown at any time up to 30 June 2016 The facility is to be repaid by 31 January 2017 The Group has a secured loan facility which is repayable by 31 December 2016 At 31 December 2015 the amount outstanding under this facility was US40 million The Directors anticipate the Group now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate projected needs The Group expects to have sufficient cash flow from its forecast production to finance its ongoing operational requirements to repay its secured and unsecured loan facilities and to at least in part fund exploration and development activity on its other gold properties However the forecasted cash flow projections for the next twelve months include a significant increase in production from the Sao Chico Mine compared with the preceding calendar year Whilst the Group has declared Commercial Production at the Sao Chico Mine there are risks associated with the commencement of any new mining operation whereby unforeseen technical and logistical events result in additional costs needing to be incurred giving rise to the possibility that additional working capital may be required Additionally the Group is exposed to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates Should additional working capital be required the Directors consider that further sources of finance could be secured within the required timescale On this basis the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis However there is no certainty that such additional funds either for working capital or for future development will be forthcoming and these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern 4 Finance Income and expense Group For the For the year ended year ended 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 US US Interest on trade financing loan 364656

mill underway Other plant expansion programmes proceeding on schedule Increased plant processing capacity expected to be operational from 1 May 2016 Operational Highlights The final quarter of 2015 recorded 79251 ounces of gold production giving a yearend total of 326291 ounces Combined mill throughput for the fourth quarter for both Palito and Sao Chico ore totalled 34848 tonnes with 130299 tonnes being milled for the year A total of 9598 metres of horizontal development across both mining operation was achieved for the year At the end of the fourth quarter surface stockpiles at Palito and Sao Chico totalled approximately16000 tonnes at a grade of 47 gt of gold November saw the commissioning of the Gekko intensive leach reactor ILR which works in tandem with the Falcon gravity centrifugal concentrator This equipment is working exclusively on the Sao Chico feed to recover gravity gold Installation of the third ball mill is well underway and this along with improvements in the flotation and CIP process circuits are on schedule to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016 A carbon regeneration kiln is also being acquired which will assist in enhancing gold recoveries once the kiln is operational in the second half of the year 1 Gold production figures are subject to amendment pending final agreed assays of the gold content of the coppergold concentrate and gold dore that is delivered to the refineries Palito development Annual mine development was 6928 metres of which 1960 metres was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 Annual mine production was 111751 tonnes at 1005 gt of which 26953 tonnes at 884 gt grammes per tonne gt was produced in the fourth quarter of 2015 Sao Chico development Annual mine development was 2997 metres of which 729 metres was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 Annual mine production was 22096 tonnes at 845 gt of which 7006 tonnes at 976 gt was produced in the fourth quarter of 2015 Sao Chico is now being developed on the 186mRL and 156mRL levels with production on the 199mRL and 186mRL levels The ramp is now being deepened to the 126mRL the next planned development level and will continue this year to the 96mRL to accommodate underground drilling of the Sao Chico deposit extension at depth Mike Hodgson CEO of Serabi commented For what has been our first full year of gold production from Palito 2015 has been a year that I can look back on with great satisfaction at what has been achieved The operational results have been excellent and the financial results show that we have achieved these in a cost effective manner Gold production in 2015 increased from 18000 ounces in 2014 to almost 33000 ounces in 2015 and we are forecasting further production growth for 2016 with Sao Chico now in commercial production We have a current target of 37000 ounces of gold production for this year and with three consecutive months of over 3000 ounces of gold production per month and approximately 6500 ounces produced during first two months of 2016 we are on target to achieve our best quarter What is even more satisfying is that these production levels have been achieved before the plant capacity improvements that we expect to complete for the beginning of May 2016 The financial results for 2015 speak for themselves we have reduced cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce have achieved a gross profit margin of 16 for 2015 and are aiming to have an all in sustaining costs of between US840 to US870 for 2016 I am very optimistic for the next twelve months We have had some welcome respite in the recovery of the gold price during the first quarter and this provides a boost to our cash generation Whilst we remain focussed on optimising the current operations should the improvement in gold prices continue and therefore provide additional cash flow we will be looking later in the year to evaluate some of our mine site discoveries that lie within the existing tenements The potential for resource growth at Palito and Sao Chico is excellent with the advantage that this resource growth can quickly be translated into low cost production growth I would like to take this opportunity to thank the team for all their hard work throughout the period I believe that 2016 will be a good year for Serabi and I look forward to updating shareholders of our continued progress through the year The latest interview with Mike Hodgson discussing the highlights of the 2015 financial year and progress at Palito and Sao Chico can be accessed using the following links httpbrrmediacoukevent141647popuptrue Chairmans Statement Serabi has enjoyed another very successful year in 2015 and continues to make strides towards its objective of becoming a gold producer with its All in Sustaining Cost AISC in the first quartile The Palito Mine exceeded our production expectations for 2015 and tonnage and grades have been in excess of the estimates with in original 2012 Preliminary Economic Assessment I fully expect that this success will continue Commercial production has also now been declared for the Sao Chico Mine and as a consequence 2016 promises to be another year of production growth The year was dominated for Serabi by a falling gold price but as with many emerging market producers the effects were mitigated by the weakness of the local currency It has been a difficult balancing act in what is our first full calendar year of operations to ensure continuity and consistency of operations whilst at the same time seeking to make cost reductions to optimise margins and safeguard the long term profitability of the business Management acknowledge the need to attain a cost base that gives the Group the best chance of dealing with the possibility of an extended period of low gold prices Whilst there has been a rally in the gold price in the early part of 2016 we have in recent years seen similar trends in the first quarter with a subsequent retrenchment over the rest of the year We are therefore far from complacent and will use this windfall as a buffer against the possibility of potential weakening later in the year The euphoria of the highs of 2011 and 2012 are well behind us and we should be grateful that golds traditional place as a safe haven has protected it against the quantum of the price declines seen in many other commodities The pain is however affecting us all and I believe that 2016 will mark a turning point that will see capitulation on the supply side This follows a lack of any new significant projects in the last two years few on the horizon and a period where some existing producers need to defer capital and resort to highgrading their operations to maintain their shortterm viability This supply shortfall should lead to an inevitable adjustment in prices By doing all we can to establish now a long term viable operation with the lowest costs possible I anticipate us being well positioned when this correction takes place Even if it takes longer to manifest itself the Group will be well protected against any further down turn in the market Serabi enjoys the benefit of an experienced management team that has been together for several years The extensive collective operational experience that they have has been a key factor in the ability to bring two mines into production on budget and within a short time frame Serabis management sets it apart from many other junior mining companies and the proven record of efficiently turning projects into cash flow is attracting support for the Group as it seeks further growth opportunities In recent years it has been difficult for mining companies to justify undertaking exploration when it has generally been a cheaper alternative to simply add additional ounces through a corporate acquisition Management have been active in assessing a number of opportunities as it is clearly an excellent time for Serabi to take advantage of the opportunities created by the market weakness However it remains difficult to find the blend of project and price that makes an acquisition compelling Whilst we consider that Serabi needs to grow and make a step change that will be reflected in its valuation the Board will not allow management to pursue opportunities that will not bring strong long term returns to our existing shareholders Of course Serabi has the added advantage of being in a highly prospective area and therefore has numerous organic growth opportunities Whilst it may be difficult to match the resource growth that an acquisition can bring on a cost per ounce basis success with our own exploration land holdings has the benefit of seeing insitu resources quickly transformed onto cash flow Pursing such organic growth creates the opportunity to build around the Palito Mine a significant hub and spoke operation bringing into play a number of small but highly profitable mines with low capital requirements in light of the leverage available from the existing operations This ability to generate production quickly with a low capital outlay is another factor which separates Serabi from many other junior exploration and development peers Whist we are very pleased with the development of Serabi over the last three years the Board is far from complacent We have each experienced the pitfalls associated with mining and the inherent risks that exist in the sector and know that despite all the best planning we can never mitigate all of these Management is constantly challenged to ensure that its plans have flexibility and that it is always seeking to mitigate risks whether geological mechanical social economic or political Only by doing this can we ensure that we have a robust profitable and sustainable business The next twelve months will bring their challenges but also their rewards I am optimistic on the outlook for gold and believe that we have now positioned Serabi to benefit from and grow on the back of it I am confident that the Group will meet or even exceed its targets for the next twelve months and in so doing build a strong financial foundation from which to realise the growth potential that it has On behalf of the board of Directors I would like to extend my appreciation to the employees and management of Serabi for a job well done during difficult times in 2015 Their hard work and determination to succeed has your company well positioned to reap the benefits of the higher gold price environment we expect during 2016 and beyond Finally thank you to our shareholders large and small for your patience during the last few years I believe the future is extremely bright for Serabi Sean Harvey  Chairman Serabis Directors Report and Financial Statements for the year

2 Auditors Opinion The auditor has issued an unqualified opinion in respect of the financial statements which does not contain any statements under the Companies Act 2006 Section 4982 or Section 4983 The auditor has raised an Emphasis of Matter in relation to going concern and the availability of project finance as follows In forming our opinion which is not modified we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in Note 1a to the financial statements concerning the groups ability to continue as a going concern Whilst the Group has access to further unsecured loan amounts in the near term these loans must be repaid by 31 January 2017 In order to meet its existing commitments and liabilities as they fall due the Group is dependent on its ability to successfully achieve planned production levels for the year from the Palito and Sao Chico mines the latter of which achieved commercial production on 1 January 2016 There are risks associated with the commencement of a new mining operation and additional working capital may be required to fund unforeseen technical and logistical events should they occur The Group is also susceptible to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates which are outside of its control These conditions along with the other matters explained in Note 1a to the financial statements indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Groups ability to continue as a going concern The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and the Company were unable to continue as a going concern NB The reference to note 1a in the above is a reference to the Basis of preparation note contained within the Financial Statements from which the extract reproduced below referring to Going Concern is taken 3 Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in force at the reporting date and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted for use within the European Union and with IFRS and their interpretations issued by the IASB The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS It is not anticipated that the adoption in the future of the new or revised standards or interpretations that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but are not yet effective will have a material impact on the Groups earnings or shareholders funds The Company has not adopted any new standards in advance of the effective dates Going concern and availability of project finance Having commenced initial development activities for the Sao Chico Mine at the end of 2014 this mine has been in development during 2015 On 1 February 2016 the Group announced that with effect from 1 January 2016 the Sao Chico Mine had achieved Commercial Production The Palito Mine has been in Commercial Production since 1 July 2014 On 30 December 2015 the Group entered into an agreement with Fratelli Investments Ltd Fratelli its major shareholder whereby Fratelli agreed to provide an unsecured short term working capital convertible loan facility of US5 million the Facility to provide additional working capital facilities On 6 January 2016 the Group announced that it had made an initial draw down of US2 million against the Facility The balance of the Facility may be drawdown at any time up to 30 June 2016 The facility is to be repaid by 31 January 2017 The Group has a secured loan facility which is repayable by 31 December 2016 At 31 December 2015 the amount outstanding under this facility was US40 million The Directors anticipate the Group now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate projected needs The Group expects to have sufficient cash flow from its forecast production to finance its ongoing operational requirements to repay its secured and unsecured loan facilities and to at least in part fund exploration and development activity on its other gold properties However the forecasted cash flow projections for the next twelve months include a significant increase in production from the Sao Chico Mine compared with the preceding calendar year Whilst the Group has declared Commercial Production at the Sao Chico Mine there are risks associated with the commencement of any new mining operation whereby unforeseen technical and logistical events result in additional costs needing to be incurred giving rise to the possibility that additional working capital may be required Additionally the Group is exposed to changes in gold price and currency exchange rates Should additional working capital be required the Directors consider that further sources of finance could be secured within the required timescale On this basis the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis However there is no certainty that such additional funds either for working capital or for future development will be forthcoming and these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern 4 Finance Income and expense Group For the For the year ended year ended 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 US US Interest on trade financing loan 364656
