of a broader consumerdriven movement to get Big Food to think differently about food manufacturing and sourcing The analysis of 192 cans tested found that 129 of them still contained BPA in the

July 14 2014 PURE announced that it has submitted a Food Contact Notification FCN to the US FDA for Silver Dihydrogen Citrate SDC as an online reprocessing OLR antimicrobial for raw poultry processingPreviously reported test results demonstrated materially significant reduction in Salmonella contamination in poultryThe FCN review period is 120 days after which if there are no concerns

produce processingThe withdrawal is based on a deficiency letter the company received from the FDA stating that the agency has developed new data that is currently under review That data calls into question the long established safety levels of the cumulative dietary intake of silver in the US resulting from the food contact uses the agency had previously approved As a result the FDA indicated that it would not approve PUREs FCN absent new data or additional information that adequately addresses its new toxicity concernsNew Development PURE has been discussing with the FDA after the

ofSalmonellarelated food borne illnesses in the US This USDA initiative drives increased scrutiny to poultry inspection and processing practicesProcessing aids or interventions commonly used in the US food industry today are highly toxic chemistries In addition pathogens can become increasingly resistant and render current interventions less efficacious As a result poultry processors need new

2H14  Balance sheet cleaned and boosted  Valuation very attractive maintain Outperform rating and raise 12month target price to 300 Pure Bioscience PURE is a revenue generating bioscience company that provides nontoxic solutions to numerous global health challengesPUREs flagship bioscience technology is a patented aqueous antimicrobial called silver dihydrogen citrate SDC SDC is a new molecular entity and is an electrolytically generated source of stabilized ionic silver that can serve as the basis for a broad range of products in diverse markets SDC liquid is colorless odorless tasteless noncaustic and formulates well with other compounds SDC is distinguished from competitors in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy combined with reduced toxicity  Unique SDCbased antimicrobial platform technology SDCbased antimicrobial technology represents innovative advances in diverse markets and lead todays global trend toward industry and consumer use of green products while providing competitive advantages in efficacy and safetySDC is a patented technology that provides stabilized silver ion complex in which a single silver ion is weakly bound stabilized to a citrate ion PURE manufactures silver dihydrogen citrate SDC using 99997 pure silver food grade citric acid and DI water The final product contains no measurable impurities or manufacturing byproducts SDCs chemical structure is 123propanetricarboxylic acid 2hydroxy silver1 salt monohydrate AgC6H7O7 View photoSDC kills microorganisms by dual modes of actionSilver ions are highly attracted to sulfurcontaining thiol groups found in metabolic and structural proteins bound to the microbial membrane surface SDC targets these critical proteins and deactivates their structure This disruption of the organisms membrane function and integrity lyses the membrane and leads to microbial death Unlike traditional antimicrobials bacteria are attracted to SDC because they recognize citric acid as a food source This Trojan Horse attack allows SDC to easily enter the microbe through membrane transport proteins Once inside the organism SDC binds to the DNA and intracellular proteins causing irreversible damage to the DNA and protein structure Metabolic and reproductive functions halt leading to its death This dual action makes SDC highly and quickly effective against a broad spectrum of microbes Silver Dihydrogen Citrate SDC represents a paradigm shift for antimicrobial disinfectant and sanitizer active ingredients It is the first new active disinfectant ingredient to be registered with the US EPA in over 35 years SDC is an effective antimicrobial exhibiting broad spectrum activity with fast kill times against bacteria grampositive and gramnegative viruses enveloped and nonenveloped and fungi SDC has a long shelf life and its low toxicity profile does not sacrifice efficacy It is active against some of the most concerning pathogens in the high density living areas and community settings including MRSA Norovirus Influenza Acinetobacter Klebsiella Vancomycinresistant Enterococci coliforms fecal and total Legionella E coli O157H7 HIV Salmonella Rotavirus H1N1 etc SDC is used to disinfect andor sanitize hard nonporous surfaces The PURE Hard Surface formulation is a stable nontoxic odorless and colorless solution which may be used in the presence of people and animals This SDC based Ready to Use formulation has demonstrated 24 hour residual activity after application to a surface and requires no rinse after application saving time and money And this SDC disinfectant and sanitizer formulation is classified in the US EPAs lowest toxicity category Category IV A Category IV rating by the US EPA means the Agency considers this formulation relatively nontoxic and they do not require any signal word or precautionary statements on the product label Compare this to other disinfectants and sanitizers on the market that in their concentrated forms and some in their Ready to Use concentrations are rated as Category I or II with Danger or Warning statements SDC represents a new generation of microbial control The Refocused StrategyIn mid2013 PURE initiated management change and corporate restructuring in order to establish new and experienced leadership focused on commercialization of SDC technology in the food industry as a unique and proprietary antimicrobial agent to protect consumer safety against various pathogens The Companys nearterm business focus is to drive customer adoption of its products in the food safety industry Its proprietary SDCbased products uniquely address food safety issues across the supply chain and help to prevent or mitigate food contamination and the potential for foodborne illness The Companys target customers will be foodservice operators food processors and food manufacturersAs part of its new commercialization focus on food safety segment PURE also strengthened its sales and marketing leadership team In late August 2013 PURE appointed Cliff Wechsler as its new Executive Vice President of Sales and Tom Myers assumed the position of Executive Vice President of Marketing and Product Development Mr Wechsler brings over 30 years of experience having previously served in a variety of high level sales management positions with Kraft Foods During his tenure at Kraft Foods Mr Wechsler shaped and developed the business strategy for their Quick Service Restaurant QSR market segmentMr Myers will now lead the companys marketing and product development having previously joined PURE in May 2011 as Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing Mr Myers brings over 40 years of food industry experience with emphasis on both food science and food processing where he served in senior leadership positions in marketing product development and technical operations With the new strategy and focus PURE has reduced costs and personnel in all departments other than sales and marketing as the company continues the push toward meaningful revenues The company has also established highcapacity outsourcing options for manufacturing to remain positioned to timely fill orders as necessaryPURE has cut total wage expenditures by more than 30 through the elimination of manufacturing research and development administrative and executive positions The company has also reduced GA expenses related to professional services including legal and consulting fees public relations and investor relations Furthermore PUREs corporate officers and directors have elected to defer the majority of cash compensation effective immediately In summary with the change in governance PURE Bioscience implemented a new business strategy focused on Commercialization of its SDCbased products as a food safety solution with a focus on foodservice and food processing  Optimization of operations and termination of noncore activities  Implementation of a lean organization with the relevant experience to drive commercialization and accelerate growth  Active and experienced board members contributing incremental insight and guidance on business strategy and execution 2Q14 financials disappointing but Growth Expected to resume in Calendar 2H14 4 On March 13 PURE reported fiscal second quarter financials for the three month ended Jan 31 2014Revenues for 2Q14 were 41000 compared with revenues of 263000 for 2Q13 a decline of 84 Total operating costs excluding sharebased compensation and restructuring costs for the second fiscal quarter of 2014 and 2013 were 16 million and 18 million respectivelyNet loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2014 was 25 million or 010 per share compared with a net loss of 18 million or 017 per share in the second fiscal quarter of 2013 The financials for fiscal 2Q14 ended Jan 31 2014 were certainly disappointing to us But we remind investors PURE has just completed the restructuring and is reborn as a new company with refocused strategy We think the new management team has built significant momentum on its refocused business strategy to commercialize its SDCbased technology as a food safety solution PURE received initial orders from its first three national food processors customers and one multinational food processor with customer rollout plans in development Pure also completed final instore testing with a national brand QSR quick service restaurant confirming multiple outstanding prior testing results where SDCbased products have continually been demonstrated to provide superior efficacyThe company also reduced its noncore operating activities by outsourcing its manufacturing operations through a strategic collaboration agreement Comprehensive manufacturing transfer will be completed by March 2014 which will reduce future facilities costs over 50 Recently PURE has established two agreements with its partners to distribute its products One is with Brenntag Specialities Inc and another one is with Intercon Chemical Company These two new agreements along with existing distribution agreements should help boost sales in the coming quarters With new management and new strategy we believe revenue will resume growing in second half of calendar 2014 We estimate total revenue for fiscal 2015 will reach 45 million representing an increase of 586 over fiscal 2014 Positive EBITDA will be achieved by fiscal 4Q15 July 31 2015 PURE will become profitable in fiscal 2016 based on total revenue of 12 million according to our financial model Earnings per share will reach 016 by fiscal 2017Balance Sheet Cleaned and Boosted At January 31 2014 PURE had 236000 in cash and cash equivalents On a pro forma basis the adjusted cash position as of January 31 2014 would be 15 million reflecting the additional 13 million in proceeds from the sale of 135 million shares of common stock raised through private equity placements as reported in its 10Q filed on March 13 2014During the fiscal 2Q14 PURE extinguished early a promissory note of 1125 million in principal and other accrued costs for approximately 500000 resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of 727000 As a consequence as of January 31 2014 the Company has no longterm debt Pure also reported that total stockholders equity increased 19 million to 890000 as of January 31 2014 as compared with July 31 2013 total stockholders deficit of 991000New management has been working diligently to strengthen PUREs balance sheet since they took office Specific measures included raising new funds and reducing noncore operating activities By reducing its noncore operating activities PURE should be able to reduce its burn rate significantly in the next few quartersThe process to restore PUREs financial condition will take several steps and we are pleased to see that the company has already made significant strides We believe the fiscal year 2014 will be both challenging and rewarding as the company sharply focuses on commercializing its patented SDCbased products in the food industry  Valuation Very Attractive We maintain our Outperform rating on PURE shares and raised our 12month price target to 300 per share from previous 250 per share Our call is based on the recent progress the company has achieved and positive developments within the company as well as the attractive valuationPURE is a technologybased bioscience company that provides solutions to numerous global health challenges PUREs proprietary high efficacylow toxicity SDCbased antimicrobials represent innovative advances in diverse markets and lead todays global trend toward industry and consumer use of green products Patented SDC is an electrolytically generated source of stabilized ionic silver which formulates well with other compounds As a platform technology SDC is distinguished from competitors in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy reduced toxicity and the inability of bacteria to form a resistance to it PUREs SDC is the first new disinfectant registered with EPA in over 30 years SDCs competitive advantages in efficacy and safety make it outstanding among its competitors and represent a paradigm shift in the disinfectantsanitizer market placeAnother key feature of SDC is that SDCbased products have broad applicability in diverse markets The Companys current focus is to expand distribution of currently approved disinfectantsanitizer products to consumers in the food safety industry Recent corporate governance change led to a new management which is experienced disciplined and resultsoriented New board will play key incremental role providing strategic insight to accelerate near term market penetrationIn terms of valuation currently the Company trades around 130 per share with a market cap of 35 million based on 27 million shares outstanding We think this is a discount based on the companys fundamentals According to our model revenue will grow at 128 CAGR in the next fiscal 4 years PURE will become profitable in fiscal 2016 with an EPS of 002 based on total revenue of 120 million With this in mind we think PURE shares should be traded at a PE ratio of 30 x Applying this PE multiple with our estimated EPS of 016 per share in fiscal 2017 discounted at 20 for 3 years we come up with a target price of 300 This values PURE at 81 million in market cap which we think is still conservative But we remind investors to keep in mind the risks Although its lead product PURE Hard Surface is increasingly gaining recognition sales may take longer time to gain traction since PURE is still in its early stage of commercialization of its SDC technology Sales so far have not been impressive SDC technology is quite new to most customers in the disinfectant market and the costs for SDC are also higher than those for most existing technologies Therefore rollout of the SDC platform will take timeCash burn is another concern Current cash will only last through the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and the Company needs to tap the capital market again Equity financing will dilute existing shareholder base A financing deal with a strategic partner should be positive to the Companys long term growthREAD FULL RESEARCH REPORT HERE SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCHto receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morningPlease visit ourwebsitefor additional

shares and raised our 12month price target to 300 per share from previous 250 per share Our call is based on the recent progress the company has achieved and positive developments within the company as well as the attractive valuationPURE is a technologybased bioscience company that provides solutions to numerous global health challenges PUREs proprietary high efficacylow toxicity SDCbased antimicrobials represent innovative advances in diverse markets and lead todays global trend toward industry and consumer use of green products Patented SDC is an electrolytically generated source of stabilized ionic silver which formulates well with other compounds As a platform technology SDC is distinguished from competitors in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy reduced toxicity and the inability of bacteria to form a resistance to it PUREs SDC is the first new disinfectant registered with EPA in over 30 years SDCs competitive advantages in efficacy and safety make it outstanding among its competitors and represent a paradigm shift in the disinfectantsanitizer market placeAnother key feature of SDC is that SDCbased products have broad applicability in diverse markets The Companys current focus is to expand distribution of currently approved disinfectantsanitizer products to consumers in the food safety industry Recent corporate governance change led to a new management which is experienced disciplined and resultsoriented New board will play key incremental role providing strategic insight to accelerate near term market penetrationIn terms of valuation currently the Company trades around 130 per share with a market cap of 35 million based on 27 million shares outstanding We think this is a discount based on the companys fundamentals According to our model revenue will grow at 128 CAGR in the next fiscal 4 years PURE will become profitable in fiscal 2016 with an EPS of 002 based on total revenue of 120 million With this in mind we think PURE shares should be traded at a PE ratio of 30 x Applying this PE multiple with our estimated EPS of 016 per share in fiscal 2017 discounted at 20 for 3 years we come up with a target price of 300 This values PURE at 81 million in market cap which we think is still conservative But we remind investors to keep in mind the risks Although its lead product PURE Hard Surface is increasingly gaining recognition sales may take longer time to gain traction since PURE is still in its early stage of commercialization of its SDC technology Sales so far have not been impressive SDC technology is quite new to most customers in the disinfectant market and the costs for SDC are also higher than those for most existing technologies Therefore rollout of the SDC platform will take timeCash burn is another concern Current cash will only last through the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and the Company needs to tap the capital market again Equity financing will dilute existing shareholder base A financing deal with a strategic partner should be positive to the Companys long term growthREAD FULL RESEARCH REPORT HERE SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCHto receive our articles and reports

conference rooms and movie theaters to hear cofounders Ells and Monty Moran apologize and provide the next steps forward for the struggling companyWe called this meeting today so that we could share with you what weve learned from the outbreaks adds EllsIn 2015 the burrito giant had four incidents relating to food outbreaksWe know the cause of three of them says Moran The salmonella outbreak in Minnesota and Wisconsin was linked to tomatoes Thats one of the reasons why we no longer dice tomatoes in our restaurantsMoran says the two norovirus outbreaks were likely caused by a mistake specifically employees coming to work while sick The CDC officially closed their investigation regarding the other Ecoli outbreak the fourth incident last MondayWe still do not know for sure what it was and we probably never will know adds Moran The events of 2015 have shown us that our recipe was out of balanceThe company now has a new plan in place that includes testing ingredients on farms and in its central kitchens and implementing techniques like blanching raw vegetables to kill germsWe have also changed the way we marinate the steak and chicken because steak and chicken can harbor dangerous germs like Ecoli and salmonella before they are cooked Moran outlined during the presentationChipotle has been in crisis mode for months since the illnesses were traced to its restaurants in

a decline of 58 This was mainly due to uneven orders a few times a year by some customers But we are pleased to see that the revenue mix attributable to food safety solutions increased over prior fiscal quarters to approximately 50 of total revenues in fiscal Q3 2015 a sequential increase from less than 10 of total revenues from fiscal 2Q15 Total operating costs and expenses excluding cost of goods sold sharebased compensation other sharebased expenses and restructuring costs for the fiscal 3Q15 and 3Q14 were 14 million and 16 million respectively Net loss for fiscal 3Q15 was 21 million 005 per share compared with 21 million 007 per share for fiscal 3Q14 Adjusted net loss for fiscal 3Q15 and fiscal 3Q14 was 13 million and 13 million respectivelyPURE exited the fiscal third quarter with a relatively strong balance sheet As of April 30 2015 cash and cash equivalents was 25 million There was no longterm debt sitting on the balance sheet In August 2014 PURE raised 79 million in an equity placement includes 4 million from strategic investor Franchise Brands LLC created by the founders of SUBWAY Restaurants This new financing provided adequate capital to fund operations for the next twelve months enabling the Company to focus on commercialization and revenue generation This new financing will also help position PURE to pursue its stated objective of uplisting to a national exchangeDuring the fiscal 2Q14 PURE extinguished early a promissory note of 1125 million in principal and other accrued costs for approximately 500000 As a consequence the Company has no longterm debt now New management has been working diligently to strengthen PUREs balance sheet since they took office Specific measures included raising new funds and reducing noncore operating activities By reducing its noncore operating activities PURE should be able to reduce its burn rate significantly in the next few quarters PURE Plans to Resubmit FCN to the FDA PURE has been discussing with the FDA after the withdrawal regarding PUREs new test data Based on these constructive discussions PURE intends to resubmit its Food Contact Notification FCN for the use of SDC as a raw poultry processing aid before the end of June 2015 The company believes that it has adequately addressed the FDAs prior issues through additional testing indicating silver residue levels of treated poultry with SDC to be virtually nondetectable and well below existing guidelines This builds upon prior SDC test results indicating the ability to reduce Salmonella below detectable levelsThe FDAs FCN review period is 120 days from submission Upon the FDAs granting of the FCN PURE intends to immediately submit the FCN to the Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS of the USDA for a new technology review As part of the FSIS review process PURE may be required to conduct inplant process validation and optimization trials with the authorization of the USDA PURE intends to provide additional updates as the regulatory review and the potential approval processes advance PURE also intends to resubmit its produce FCN The company is currently conducting additional produce testing for silver residue levels for the application of SDC as a processing aid for produceIf the new test results continue to adequately address the prior FDA issues PURE intends to resubmit its FCN for produce during the summerFurther PURE continues its product development efforts for the application of SDC as processing aidintervention for beef and pork Pending positive test results PURE expects to file the FCN for beef and pork thereafterBased on these updates we expect the commercial launch of SDC as raw poultry processing aid and produce by the end of calendar 2015 Update on Business Development and OperationsPURE

cruise line industry Intercon has shipped PURE Hard Surface disinfectant into a major international cruise line for onship pilot commercial testing for its USbased fleet Intercon intends to commence onship testing of PURE Hard Surface disinfectant with two additional cruise lines during calendar 2015This new business segment is an important technology validation of SDC Also PURE could derive modest royalty income from sales made by Intercon to the cruise line industryWe Expect Strong Revenue Growth in Fiscal 2015 and Beyond PURE is now active in three market segments  Restaurants testing and sales food manufacturingprocessing testing and sales and cruise lines testing Management has set the calendar 2015 goals Secure customer adoption in food safety with 2 national restaurant chains and 10 national food processors Leverage outsourcing of operations and supply chain Subject to updated feedback from the FDA secure FDA and USDA authorization for use of SDC as a direct food contactprocessing aid for poultry produce beef and pork and Continue to outlicense PURE distribution and SDC applications to noncore markets Based on the Companys current marketing plan and recent developments we expect that strong revenue growth will be achieved in calendar 2015 and beyond We remind investors that PURE recently completed the restructuring and is reborn as a new company with refocused strategy on food safety We think the new management team has built significant momentum on its refocused business strategy to commercialize its SDCbased technology as a food safety solution During the second half of fiscal 2014 the new management team generated significant momentum in advancing its business strategy to commercialize its SDCbased technology as a food safety solution PURE extended commercial market test launch of PURE Hard Surface Disinfectant to over 650 Subway stores and is selling this product in all of its 27000 stores Customer feedback on both SDC product performance and ease of use are very positive The phased US national rollout is under way With new management and new strategy we believe revenue will grow significantly in fiscal 2015 and beyond Specifically we estimate total revenue for fiscal 2015 will reach 08 million representing an increase of 45 over fiscal 2014 The Company will become profitable in fiscal 2018 based on total revenue of 225 million according to our financial model Earnings per share will reach 024 by fiscal 2020 based on revenue of 385 million SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCHtoreceive our articles and reports

following reports 80 Boston College students had fallen ill after eating at the Mexican chain In a statement Chipotle said it had temporarily closed its store at Cleveland Circle in Boston while the investigation into the cause of the outbreak continuedWe do not have any evidence to suggest that this incident is related to the previous E coli incident and there are no confirmed cases of E coli connected to Chipotle in Massachusetts the company saidMarler adds that it isnt all in the hands of the restaurants and grocery stores chains either and that consumers need to be more responsible and vigilant tooEveryone has to pay attention to cross contamination in their homes and frankly consumers need to hold restaurants accountable for poisoning and sickening them I think that is what helps

great example adds MarlerShares of Chipotle took another beating Tuesday following reports 80 Boston College students had fallen ill after eating at the Mexican chain In a statement Chipotle said it had temporarily closed its store at Cleveland Circle in Boston while the investigation into the cause of the outbreak continuedWe do not have any evidence to suggest that this incident is related to the previous E coli incident and there are no confirmed cases of E coli connected to Chipotle in Massachusetts the company saidMarler adds that it isnt all in the hands of the restaurants and grocery stores chains either and that consumers need to be more responsible and vigilant tooEveryone has to pay attention to cross contamination in their homes and frankly consumers need to hold restaurants accountable for poisoning and sickening them I think that is what helps change behavior And move the system forwardRelated ArticlesHigher Health Care Costs Top Concern For 2016 Fidelity Study Shows

infections according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The companys reputation was badly battered and it bled billions in legal and medical expenses as well as lost business in the years that followed Its now mostly ancient history for Jack in the Box which has restored its brand sales share price and place among the nations leading chains But the story is recalled in the recent trials of Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG 134 which sickened 55 in an E coli outbreak that ran from October to December Reuters The inside of an empty Chipotle Mexican Grill in New York City seen through the window at lunchtime on Feb 8 2016 The chain closed stores for lunch nationwide for a meeting on food safety following a number of E coli outbreaks Few of Chipotles customers likely recall Jack in the Boxs nightmare  Many werent even alive at the time But the way the burger chain eventually rebuilt itself  by focusing on its product culture and messaging  offers a view of Chipotles way forward These are incredibly ill kids Jack in the Boxs story began in November 1992 as cases of E coli  the source of which was initially unknown  emerged in the Pacific Northwest About 50 people mostly children had been affected by the time officials linked the illness to the restaurant chain the next January The cases skewed young as more cases were identified A January 1993 Seattle Times story said that of 150 cases twothirds were 15 years old and younger Health officials have said the particular strain of the bacteria E coli 0157 H7 is especially dangerous to the very young These are incredibly ill kids Dr Ellis Avner then the director of nephrology at Childrens Hospital in Seattle told the Times in January 1993 Threeyearold Mary Dolan one of the earlier cases grew feverish and then had cramps and bloody diarrhea after eating a Jack in the Box cheeseburger After she was hospitalized she had a seizure and a stroke Mary improved but others were less fortunate The first to die Tacoma Wash twoyearold Michael Nole succumbed to kidney and heart failure in late January after eating an infected cheeseburger His parents eventually settled with the company for more than 1 million By the end of January 1993 more than 300 reports of E coli were connected to Jack in the Box the count eclipsed 450 by the end of February Mild cases of E coli 0157 H7 can pass in a week but many saw worstcase scenarios play out experiencing excessive bleeding and central nervous system damage At least 29 had kidney failure Jack in the Box then the fifthlargest American burger chain had about 1200 restaurants all in the western US The ourbreak covered the same ground As the numbers grew so did the certainty that Jack in the Box was the culprit Virtually all of the infected burgers were linked to the company according to health officials Sales and profits quickly dropped Shares of Jack in the Box then trading as parent company Foodmaker Inc fell from highs around 14 before the outbreak to below 10 by January 22 Plans for new restaurants were shelved In one twoweek period in January sales were 35 below the previous years levels The effects lingered with fullyear 1995 sales nearly 20 below 1993 revenues The company did not respond to a request for an interview about its 1990s troubles and their parallels with Chipotle today Today though Jack is still standing  and then some It remains the fifthlargest US burger chain and has about 1000 more restaurants than in 1993 Its shares have substantially outperformed the SP 500 this decade Perhaps most telling it shed the Foodmaker name in 1999 and is now known simply by its oncebeleaguered brand name Jack in the Box How a company rebuilt its food culture Even after it became clear that Jack in the Box had served tainted hamburgers the company and its suppliers dodged responsibility blaming each other The general source of the illnesses was known early on  E coli 0157 H7 is associated with cows  but investigators didnt know if it originated with the beef itself or the way it was cooked and handled Soon after investigators determined that Jack in the Box was the source of the illness the company blamed its meat supplier which denied responsibility It turned out that both played a role Jack in the Box wasnt cooking its burgers to high enough temperatures though the meat had been so contaminated that it might not have mattered The distinction didnt matter to customers the food was making people sick Customer confidence and sales were down and those who did brave the chain avoided hamburgers Once Jack in the Box was implicated in the spread of the illness it discarded and replaced all of the hamburger meat from its Washington stores and extended cooking time for hamburgers Two days later it hired David Theno as a consultant later bringing him on fulltime to guide a twoyear food safety plan Theno who is now working with Chipotle declined to answer questions about his work with that company though he agreed to share viewpoints about bringing a restaurant chain back from the brink Chipotle did not respond to several requests for an interview about its work with Theno and how its issues compare with Jack in the Boxs Evidence would later show that the E coli had been introduced in the slaughterhouse although the fast food chain was also undercooking its burgers relative to state guidelines that had been adopted earlier in 1992 Jack in the Box quickly replaced its meat processor The Vons Cos later suing it  and its eight beef suppliers  charging negligence Jack in the Box got roughly 60 million from them in a 1998 settlement Vons now owned by privately owned Albertsons is no longer in the meat processing business The company then looked to rebuild its roster of suppliers applying additional scrutiny to all of its ingredients  not just beef according to Theno It developed a system that used spot microbiological testing of randomly selected items to profile and select reliable suppliers In the restaurants themselves cooking temperatures were changed cooks began handling patties with gloves and new tools for calibrating grill temperature were adopted The chain implemented Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point a set of food safety management standards developed decades earlier and trained managers in ServSafe an industry program geared toward preventing foodborne illness Many of these innovations existed at the time but Jack in the Box was the first to use them all according to Theno People had bits and pieces but nobody had the full thing he said Today theyre standard at most restaurants Jack in the Box had to change its culture along with its processes according to Theno who ended up working there for 15 years and is now CEO of consulting business Gray Dog Partners Food safety had to be the default position he said While food safety controls had been a part of the companys culture they werent as integral as those for sales or labor costs according to Theno HAACP gave Jack in the Box a way to measure food safety and give restaurant workers a stake in the outcome illustrating what they needed to do why it mattered and how important it was to customer safety Theno even invited representatives from other fast food companies to visit and observe which he believes helped spread many modern food safety techniques into the mainstream People want to do the right thing when they know what the right thing is said Theno None of the people at Jack in the Box ever thought anything like that would happen but once it did they wanted to make sure nothing like that ever did again Meanwhile Jack in the Box worked to rebuild its brand The company apologized early and often detailing the internal changes it was making in its advertising After the first E coli death it ran ads in Western Washington newspapers with a tollfree number customers could call for more information about their cleanup efforts Nugent apologized in a commercial aired on network television And in February 1993 Jack in the Box offered to pay affected customers medical costs This is a horrible event Jack in the Box Chairman Jack Goodall wrote in a

a decline of 58 This was mainly due to uneven orders a few times a year by some customers But we are pleased to see that the revenue mix attributable to food safety solutions increased over prior fiscal quarters to approximately 50 of total revenues in fiscal Q3 2015 a sequential increase from less than 10 of total revenues from fiscal 2Q15 Total operating costs and expenses excluding cost of goods sold sharebased compensation other sharebased expenses and restructuring costs for the fiscal 3Q15 and 3Q14 were 14 million and 16 million respectively Net loss for fiscal 3Q15 was 21 million 005 per share compared with 21 million 007 per share for fiscal 3Q14 Adjusted net loss for fiscal 3Q15 and fiscal 3Q14 was 13 million and 13 million respectivelyPURE exited the fiscal third quarter with a relatively strong balance sheet As of April 30 2015 cash and cash equivalents was 25 million There was no longterm debt sitting on the balance sheet In August 2014 PURE raised 79 million in an equity placement includes 4 million from strategic investor Franchise Brands LLC created by the founders of SUBWAY Restaurants This new financing provided adequate capital to fund operations for the next twelve months enabling the Company to focus on commercialization and revenue generation This new financing will also help position PURE to pursue its stated objective of uplisting to a national exchangeDuring the fiscal 2Q14 PURE extinguished early a promissory note of 1125 million in principal and other accrued costs for approximately 500000 As a consequence the Company has no longterm debt now New management has been working diligently to strengthen PUREs balance sheet since they took office Specific measures included raising new funds and reducing noncore operating activities By reducing its noncore operating activities PURE should be able to reduce its burn rate significantly in the next few quarters PURE Plans to Resubmit FCN to the FDA PURE has been discussing with the FDA after the withdrawal regarding PUREs new test data Based on these constructive discussions PURE intends to resubmit its Food Contact Notification FCN for the use of SDC as a raw poultry processing aid before the end of June 2015 The company believes that it has adequately addressed the FDAs prior issues through additional testing indicating silver residue levels of treated poultry with SDC to be virtually nondetectable and well below existing guidelines This builds upon prior SDC test results indicating the ability to reduce Salmonella below detectable levelsThe FDAs FCN review period is 120 days from submission Upon the FDAs granting of the FCN PURE intends to immediately submit the FCN to the Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS of the USDA for a new technology review As part of the FSIS review process PURE may be required to conduct inplant process validation and optimization trials with the authorization of the USDA PURE intends to provide additional updates as the regulatory review and the potential approval processes advance PURE also intends to resubmit its produce FCN The company is currently conducting additional produce testing for silver residue levels for the application of SDC as a processing aid for produceIf the new test results continue to adequately address the prior FDA issues PURE intends to resubmit its FCN for produce during the summerFurther PURE continues its product development efforts for the application of SDC as processing aidintervention for beef and pork Pending positive test results PURE expects to file the FCN for beef and pork

contactprocessing aid for poultry produce beef and pork and Continue to outlicense PURE distribution and SDC applications to noncore markets Based on the Companys current marketing plan and recent developments we expect that strong revenue growth will be achieved in calendar 2015 and beyond We remind investors that PURE recently completed the restructuring and is reborn as a new company with refocused strategy on food safety We think the new management team has built significant momentum on its refocused business strategy to commercialize its SDCbased technology as a food safety solution During the second half of fiscal 2014 the new management team generated significant momentum in advancing its business strategy to commercialize its SDCbased technology as a food safety solution PURE extended commercial market test launch of PURE Hard Surface Disinfectant to over 650 Subway stores and is selling this product in all of its 27000 stores Customer feedback on both SDC product performance and ease of use are very positive The phased US national rollout is under way With new management and new strategy we believe revenue will grow significantly in fiscal 2015 and beyond

while its too soon to tell whether SpoonRockets situation mirrors other underdogs in the ondemand food industry other startups are likely to follow SpoonRocket and exit the space said Brita Rosenheim food and lifestyle industry strategist at Rosenheim Advisors There will be consolidation but also less players in the space Rosenheim said The main reason is in order to make the margins work on this

Uber have branched out into meal delivery The food technology space has hit maturity at a time when when venture capital as a whole is cooling on a macro level Wong said A fooddelivery service making dinner healthy Funding slowed down in Q4 across the board and scrutiny changed from when it was free flowing in the earlier half of 2015 Wong said As later stage investors like mutual funds enter the scene theyll look beyond the novelty of an idea toward how it is being executed especially since the barriers to entry in the food delivery industry are so low Rosenheim said What is the lifetime

UberEats the food delivery app will add competitive pressure to Amazoncom AMZN and GrubHub GRUB both of which have competing restaurant delivery offerings GrubHub stock was down 5 in early afternoon trading in the stock market today while Amazon stock was flat UberEats is an expansion of the companys instant delivery service which offers a fixed menu and deliveries in as little as 10 minutes UberEats is partnering with hundreds of restaurants to make food delivery available seven days a week according to the companys blog Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman conducted tests of UberEats in Santa Monica Calif and found that the apps estimates  30 minutes or less with a midpoint around 11 minutes  beat Amazon Prime Now Restaurants nationwide average of 39 minutes GrubHub does not provide precise timing information because it doesnt make the delivery itself Kopelman pointed out in a research note Monday Amazon offers estimates within the hour Kopelman says that UberEats has changed tocurbside delivery only which means that drivers will not meet customers at the door as is the norm in food delivery Kopelman says that changing to curbside lets the company more easily integrate existing drivers for UberX  its taxilike service where drivers use personal cars to ferry passengers  which the firm is using as a primary source for delivery recruitment An Uberspokeswoman told IBD that the companys instant delivery is curbside but she added that its regular restaurant delivery in most cases is doortodoor Unlike Amazon and GrubHub UberEats does not allow tipping within the app  though customers can give the driver a cash tip  and its fees are among the lowest among its competitors according to Kopelman Amazon does not charge a delivery fee at least for now Our initial impressions of UberEats in Los Angeles make us incrementally more cautious on the competitive environment for GrubHub Kopelman wrote The UberEats app and curbside restaurant delivery are set to roll out in Chicago Houston Los Angeles San Francisco and Toronto according to the companys blog Seven other major markets are set to open around the corner  including Melbourne New York and Paris Troubled Market But if startups are any indication then UberEats Amazon and GrubHub are vying for amarket that is looking at a troubled future Tuesday TechCrunch reported that SpoonRocket a food delivery app

"summary": "Ridebooking firm Uber announced in a blog post Tuesday that it was expanding its restaurant delivery service and spinning it off from the main Uber mobile app Called UberEats the food delivery app will add competitive pressure to Amazoncom AMZN and GrubHub GRUB both of which have competing restaurant delivery offerings GrubHub stock was down 5 in early afternoon trading in the stock market today while Amazon stock was flat UberEats is an expansion of the companys instant delivery service which offers a fixed menu and deliveries in as little as 10 minutes UberEats is partnering with hundreds of restaurants to make food delivery available seven days a week according to the companys blog Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman conducted tests of UberEats in Santa Monica Calif and found that the apps estimates  30 minutes or less with a midpoint around 11 minutes  beat Amazon Prime Now Restaurants nationwide average of 39 minutes GrubHub does not provide precise timing information because it doesnt make the delivery itself Kopelman pointed out in a research note Monday Amazon offers estimates within the hour Kopelman says that UberEats has changed tocurbside delivery only which means that drivers will not meet customers at the door as is the norm in food delivery Kopelman says that changing to curbside lets the company more easily integrate existing drivers for UberX  its taxilike service where drivers use personal cars to ferry passengers  which the firm is using as a primary source for delivery recruitment An Uberspokeswoman told IBD that the companys instant delivery is curbside but she added that its regular restaurant delivery in most cases is doortodoor Unlike Amazon and GrubHub UberEats does not allow tipping within the app  though customers can give the driver a cash tip  and its fees are among the lowest among its competitors according to Kopelman Amazon does not charge a delivery fee at least for now Our initial impressions of UberEats in Los Angeles make us incrementally more cautious on the competitive environment for GrubHub Kopelman wrote The UberEats app and curbside restaurant delivery are set to roll out in Chicago Houston Los Angeles San Francisco and Toronto according to the companys blog Seven other major markets are set to open around the corner  including Melbourne New York and Paris Troubled Market
